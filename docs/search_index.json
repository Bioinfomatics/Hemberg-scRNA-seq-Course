The main advantage of scRNA-seq is that the cellular resolution and the genome wide scope makes it possible to address issues that are intractable using other methods, e.g. bulk RNA-seq or single-cell RT-qPCR. However, to analyze scRNA-seq data, novel methods are required and some of the underlying assumptions for the methods developed for bulk RNA-seq experiments are no longer valid. In this course we will discuss some of the questions that can be addressed using scRNA-seq as well as the available computational and statistical methods avialable. The course is taught through the University of Cambridge Bioinformatics training unit, but the material found on these pages is meant to be used for anyone interested in learning about computational analysis of scRNA-seq data. The course is taught twice per year and the material here is updated prior to each event. The number of computational tools is increasing rapidly and we are doing our best to keep up to date with what is available. One of the main constraints for this course is that we would like to use tools that are implemented in R and that run reasonably fast. Moreover, we will also confess to being somewhat biased towards methods that have been developed either by us or by our friends and colleagues. 1.1 Video 1.2 Registration Please follow this link and register for the “Analysis of single cell RNA-seq data” course: http://training.csx.cam.ac.uk/bioinformatics/search 1.3 GitHub https://github.com/hemberg-lab/scRNA.seq.course 1.4 Docker container If you do not want to install all the packages manually, you can run a course docker container which contains all the required packages.

Datasets range from \\(10^2\\) to \\(10^5\\) cells and increase in size every year Currently there are several different protocols in use, e.g. SMART-seq2 (Picelli et al. 2013), CELL-seq (Hashimshony et al. 2012) and Drop-seq (Macosko et al. 2015) There are also commercial platforms available, including the Fluidigm C1 and the 10X Genomics Chromium Several computational analysis methods from bulk RNA-seq can be used In most cases computational analysis requires adaptation of the existing methods or development of new ones 3.3 Workflow Figure 3.1: Single cell sequencing (taken from Wikipedia) Overall, experimental scRNA-seq protocols are similar to the methods used for bulk RNA-seq. We will be discussing some of the most common approaches in the next chapter. 3.4 Computational Analysis This course is concerned with the computational analysis of the data obtained from scRNA-seq experiments. The first steps (yellow) are general for any highthroughput sequencing data. Later steps (orange) require a mix of existing RNASeq analysis methods and novel methods to address the technical difference of scRNASeq. Finally the biological interpretation should be analyzed with methods specifically developed for scRNASeq. Figure 3.2: Flowchart of the scRNA-seq analysis There are several reviews of the scRNA-seq analysis available including (Stegle, Teichmann, and Marioni 2015). 3.5 Challenges The main difference between bulk and single cell RNA-seq is that each sequencing library represents a single cell, instead of a population of cells. Therefore, significant attention has to be paid to comparison of the results from different cells (sequencing libraries). The main sources of discrepancy between the libraries are: Amplification (up to 1 million fold) Gene ‘dropouts’ in which a gene is observed at a moderate expression level in one cell but is not detected in another cell (Kharchenko, Silberstein, and Scadden 2014). In both cases the discrepancies are introduced due to low starting amounts of transcripts since the RNA comes from one cell only. Improving the transcript capture efficiency and reducing the amplification bias are currently active areas of research. However, as we shall see in this course, it is possible to alleviate some of these issues through proper normalization and corrections. References "],
["overview-of-experimental-methods-for-generating-scrna-seq-data.html", "4 Overview of experimental methods for generating scRNA-seq data", " 4 Overview of experimental methods for generating scRNA-seq data Development of new methods and protocols for scRNA-seq is currently a very active area of research, and several protocols have been published over the last few years. The methods can be categorized in different ways, but the two most important aspects are quantification and capture. For quantification, there are two types, full-length and tag-based. The former tries to achieve a uniform read coverage of each transcript. By contrast, tag-based protocols only capture either the 5’- or 3’-end of each RNA. The choice of quantification method has important implications for what types of analyses the data can be used for. In theory, full-length protocols should provide an even coverage of transcripts, but as we shall see, there are often biases in the coverage. The main advantage of tag-based protocol is that they can be combined with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) which can help improve the quantification (see chapter 6). On the other hand, being restricted to one end of the transcript may reduce the mappability and it also makes it harder to distinguish different isoforms (Archer et al. 2016). The strategy used for capture determines how the cells can be selected as well as what kind of additional information besides the sequencing that can be obtained. The three most widely used options are microwell-, microfluidic- and droplet- based. For well-based platforms, cells are isolated using for example pipette or laser capture and placed in microfluidic wells. One advantage of well-based methods can be combined with fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS), making it possible to select cells based on surface markers. This strategy is thus very useful for situations when one wants to isolate a specific subset of cells for sequencing. Another advantage is that one can take pictures of the cells. The image provides an additional modality and a particularly useful application is to identify wells containg damaged cells or doublets. The main drawback of these methods is that they are low-throughput and the amount of work required per cell may be considerable. Microfluidic platforms, such as Fluidigm’s C1, provide a more integrated system for capturing cells and for carrying out the reactions necessary for the library preparations. Thus, they provide a higher throughput than microwell based platforms. Typically, only around 10% of cells are captured in a microfluidic platform and thus they are not appropriate if one is dealing with rare cell-types or very small amounts of input. Moreover, the chip is relatively expensive, but since reactions can be carried out in a smaller volume money can be saved on reagents. The idea behind droplet based methods is to encapsulate each individual cell inside a nanoliter droplet together with a bead. The bead is loaded with the enzymes required to construct the library. In particular, each bead contains a unique barcode which is attached to all of the reads originating from that cell. Thus, all of the droplets can be pooled, sequenced together and the reads can subsequently be assigned to the cell of origin based on the barcodes. Droplet platforms typically have the highest throughput since the library preparation costs are on the order of .05 USD/cell. Instead, sequencing costs often become the limiting factor and a typical experiment the coverage is low with only a few thousand different transcripts detected (Ziegenhain et al. 2017).

["what-platform-to-use-for-my-experiment.html", "5 What platform to use for my experiment?", " 5 What platform to use for my experiment? The most suitable platform depends on the biological question at hand. For example, if one is interested in characterizing the composition of a tissue, then a droplet-based method which will allow a very large number of cells to be captured is likely to be the most appropriate. On the other hand, if one is interesting in characterizing a rare cell-population for which there is a known surface marker, then it is probably best to enrich using FACS and then sequence a smaller number of cells. Clearly, full-length transcript quantification will be more appropriate if one is interested in studying different isoforms since tagged protocols are much more limited. By contrast, UMIs can only be used with tagged protocols and they can facilitate gene-level quantification. "],
["construction-of-expression-matrix.html", "6 Construction of expression matrix 6.1 Reads QC 6.2 Reads alignment 6.3 Alignment example 6.4 Mapping QC 6.5 Reads quantification", " 6 Construction of expression matrix Many analyses of scRNA-seq data take as their starting point an expression matrix. By convention, the each row of the expression matrix represents a gene and each column represents a cell (although some authors use the transpose). Each entry represents the expression level of a particular gene in a given cell. The units by which the expression is meassured depends on the protocol and the normalization strategy used. 6.1 Reads QC The output from a scRNA-seq experiment is a large collection of cDNA reads. The first step is to ensure that the reads are of high quality. The quality control can be performed by using standard tools, such as FastQC or Kraken. Assuming that our reads are in experiment.bam, we run FastQC as $&lt;path_to_fastQC&gt;/fastQC experiment.bam Below is an example of the output from FastQC for a dataset of 125 bp reads. The plot reveals a technical error which resulted in a couple of bases failing to be read correctly in the centre of the read. However, since the rest of the read was of high quality this error will most likely have a negligible effect on mapping efficiency. Figure 6.1: Example of FastQC output Additionally, it is often helpful to visualize the data using the Integrative Genomics Browser (IGV) or SeqMonk. 6.2 Reads alignment After trimming low quality bases from the reads, the remaining sequences can be mapped to a reference genome. Again, there is no need for a special purpose method for this, so we can use the STAR or the TopHat aligner. For large full-transcript datasets from well annotated organisms (e.g. mouse, human) pseudo-alignment methods (e.g. Kallisto, Salmon) may out-perform conventional alignment. For drop-seq based datasets with tens- or hundreds of thousands of reads pseudoaligners become more appealing since their run-time can be several orders of magnitude less than traditional aligners. An example of how to map reads.bam to using STAR is $&lt;path_to_STAR&gt;/STAR --runThreadN 1 --runMode alignReads --readFilesIn reads1.fq.gz reads2.fq.gz --readFilesCommand zcat --genomeDir &lt;path&gt; --parametersFiles FileOfMoreParameters.txt --outFileNamePrefix &lt;outpath&gt;/output Note, if the spike-ins are used, the reference sequence should be augmented with the DNA sequence of the spike-in molecules prior to mapping. Note, when UMIs are used, their barcodes should be removed from the read sequence. A common practice is to add the barcode to the read name. Once the reads for each cell have been mapped to the reference genome, we need to make sure that a sufficient number of reads from each cell could be mapped to the reference genome. In our experience, the fraction of mappable reads for mouse or human cells is 60-70%. However, this result may vary depending on protocol, read length and settings for the read alignment. As a general rule, we expect all cells to have a similar fraction of mapped reads, so any outliers should be inspected and possibly removed. A low proportion of mappable reads usually indicates contamination. 6.3 Alignment example The histogram below shows the total number of reads mapped to each cell for an scRNA-seq experiment. Each bar represents one cell, and they have been sorted in ascending order by the total number of reads per cell. The three red arrows indicate cells that are outliers in terms of their coverage and they should be removed from further analysis. The two yellow arrows point to cells with a surprisingly large number of unmapped reads. In this example we kept the cells during the alignment QC step, but they were later removed during cell QC due to a high proportion of ribosomal RNA reads. Figure 6.2: Example of the total number of reads mapped to each cell. 6.4 Mapping QC After mapping the raw sequencing to the genome we need to evaluate the quality of the mapping. There are many ways to measure the mapping quality, including: amount of reads mapping to rRNA/tRNAs, proportion of uniquely mapping reads, reads mapping across splice junctions, read depth along the transcripts. Methods developed for bulk RNA-seq, such as RSeQC, are applicable to single-cell data: python &lt;RSeQCpath&gt;/geneBody_coverage.py -i input.bam -r genome.bed -o output.txt python &lt;RSeQCpath&gt;/bam_stat.py -i input.bam -r genome.bed -o output.txt python &lt;RSeQCpath&gt;/split_bam.py -i input.bam -r rRNAmask.bed -o output.txt However the expected results will depend on the experimental protocol, e.g. many scRNA-seq methods use poly-A selection to avoid sequencing rRNAs which results in a 3’ bias in the read coverage across the genes (aka gene body coverage). The figure below shows this 3’ bias as well as three cells which were outliers and removed from the dataset: Figure 6.3: Example of the 3’ bias in the read coverage. 6.5 Reads quantification The next step is to quantify the expression level of each gene for each cell. For mRNA data, we can use one of the tools which has been developed for bulk RNA-seq data, e.g. HT-seq or FeatureCounts # include multimapping &lt;featureCounts_path&gt;/featureCounts -O -M -Q 30 -p -a genome.gtf -o outputfile input.bam # exclude multimapping &lt;featureCounts_path&gt;/featureCounts -Q 30 -p -a genome.gtf -o outputfile input.bam Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) make it possible to count the absolute number of molecules and they have proven popular for scRNA-seq. We will discuss how UMIs can be processed in the next chapter. "],

They enable sequencing reads to be assigned to individual transcript molecules and thus the removal of amplification noise and biases from scRNASeq data. Figure 7.1: UMI sequencing protocol When sequencing UMI containing data, techniques are used to specifically sequence only the end of the transcript containing the UMI (usually the 3’ end). 7.2 Mapping Barcodes Since the number of unique barcodes (4^N, N=length of UMI) is much smaller than the total number of molecules per cell (~10^6), each barcode will typically be assigned to multiple transcripts. Hence, to identify unique molecules both barcode and mapping location (transcript) must be used. The first step is to map UMI reads, for which we recommend using STAR since it is fast and outputs good quality BAM-alignments. Moreover, mapping locations can be useful for eg. identifying poorly-annotated 3’ UTRs of transcripts. UMI-sequencing typically consists of paired-end reads where one read from each pair captures the cell and UMI barcodes while the other read consists of exonic sequence from the transcript (Figure 7.2). Note that trimming and/or filtering to remove reads containing poly-A sequence is recommended to avoid erors due to these read mapping to genes/transcripts with internal poly-A/poly-T sequences. After processing the reads from a UMI experiment, the following conventions are often used: The UMI is added to the read name of the other paired read. Reads are sorted into separate files by cell barcode For extremely large, shallow datasets, the cell barcode may be added to the read name as well to reduce the number of files. Figure 7.2: UMI sequencing reads, red lightning bolts represent different fragmentation locations 7.3 Counting Barcodes In theory, every unique UMI-transcript pair should represent all reads originating from a single RNA molecule. However, in practice this is frequently not the case and the most common reasons are: Different UMI doesn’t necessarily mean different molecule Due to PCR or sequencing errors, base-pair substitution events can result in new UMI sequences. Longer UMIs give more opportunity for errors to arise and based on estimates from cell barcodes we expect 7-10% of 10bp UMIs to contain at least one error. If not corrected for, this type of error will result in an overestimate of the number of transcripts. Different transcript doesn’t necessarily mean different molecule Mapping errors and/or multimapping reads may result in some UMIs being assigned to the wrong gene/transcript. This type of error will also result in an overestimate of the number of transcripts. Same UMI doesn’t necessarily mean same molecule Biases in UMI frequency and short UMIs can result in the same UMI being attached to different mRNA molecules from the same gene. Thus, the number of transcripts may be underestimated. Figure 7.3: Potential Errors in UMIs 7.4 Correcting for Errors How to best account for errors in UMIs remains an active area of research. The best approaches that we are aware of for resolving the issues mentioned above are: UMI-tools’ directional-adjacency method implements a procedure which considers both the number of mismatches and the relative frequency of similar UMIs to identify likely PCR/sequencing errors. Currently an open question. The problem may be mitigated by removing UMIs with few reads to support their association with a particular transcript, or by removing all multi-mapping reads. Simple saturation (aka “collision probability”) correction proposed by Grun, Kester and van Oudenaarden (2014) to estimate the true number of molecules \\(M\\): \\[M \\approx -N*log(1 - \\frac{n}{N})\\] where N = total number of unique UMI barcodes and n = number of observations of a specific barcode. + An important caveat of this method is that it assumes that all UMIs are equally frequent. In most cases this is incorrect, since there is often a bias related to the GC content. Figure 7.4: Per gene amplification rate Exercise 1 Blischak et al. used 6bp UMI barcodes for their experiments and you can load this data using the command below. molecules &lt;- read.table(&quot;blischak/molecules.txt&quot;, sep = &quot;\\t&quot;) Estimate the true number of molecules by correcting for collisions and sequencing errors using the simple saturation approach. Assume a 1% per base-pair sequencing error rate and that the errors follow a binomial distribution. 7.5 Downstream Analysis Current UMI platforms (DropSeq, InDrop, ICell8) exhibit low and highly variable capture efficiency as shown in the figure below. Figure 7.5: Variability in Capture Efficiency This variability can introduce strong biases and it needs to be considered in downstream analysis. Recent analyses often pool cells/genes together based on cell-type or biological pathway to increase the power. Robust statistical analyses of this data is still an open research question and it remains to be determined how to best adjust for biases. Exercise 2 Load the read counts from the Blischak data using the command below. reads &lt;- read.table(&quot;blischak/reads.txt&quot;, sep = &quot;\\t&quot;) Using this data and the unadjusted molecule counts from above: Plot the variability in capture efficiency Determine the amplification rate: average number of reads per UMI.

The package contains several useful methods for quality control, visualisation and pre-processing of data prior to further downstream analysis. scater features the following functionality: Automated computation of QC metrics Transcript quantification from read data with pseudo-alignment Data format standardisation Rich visualizations for exploratory analysis Seamless integration into the Bioconductor universe Simple normalisation methods We highly recommend to use scater for all single-cell RNA-seq analyses and scater is the basis of the first part of the course. 8.2 scater workflow As illustrated in the figure below, scater will help you with quality control, filtering and normalization of your expression matrix following mapping and alignment. 8.3 Terminology (this chapter is taken from the scater vignette) The capabilities of scater are built on top of Bioconductor’s Biobase. In Bioconductor terminology we assay numerous “features” for a number of “samples”. Features, in the context of scater, correspond most commonly to genes or transcripts, but could be any general genomic or transcriptomic regions (e.g. exon) of interest for which we take measurements. In the following chapters it may be more intuitive to mentally replace “feature” with “gene” or “transcript” (depending on the context of the study) wherever “feature” appears. In the scater context, “samples” refer to individual cells that we have assayed. 8.4 SCESet class (this chapter is taken from the scater vignette) In scater we organise single-cell expression data in objects of the SCESet class. The class inherits the Bioconductor ExpressionSet class, which provides a common interface familiar to those who have analyzed microarray experiments with Bioconductor. The class requires three input files: exprs, a numeric matrix of expression values, where rows are features, and columns are cells phenoData, an AnnotatedDataFrame object, where rows are cells, and columns are cell attributes (such as cell type, culture condition, day captured, etc.) featureData, an AnnotatedDataFrame object, where rows are features (e.g. genes), and columns are feature attributes, such as biotype, gc content, etc. For more details about other features inherited from Bioconductor’s ExpressionSet class, type ?ExpressionSet at the R prompt. When the data are encapsulated in the SCESet class, scater will automatically calculate several different properties. This will be demonstrated in the subsequent chapters. "],

This matrix should be examined to remove poor quality cells which were not detected in either read QC or mapping QC steps. Failure to remove low quality cells at this stage may add technical noise which has the potential to obscure the biological signals of interest in the downstream analysis. Since there is currently no standard method for performing scRNASeq the expected values for the various QC measures that will be presented here can vary substantially from experiment to experiment. Thus, to perform QC we will be looking for cells which are outliers with respect to the rest of the dataset rather than comparing to independent quality standards. Consequently, care should be taken when comparing quality metrics across datasets collected using different protocols. 9.2 Blischak dataset To illustrate cell QC, we consider a dataset of induced pluripotent stem cells generated from three different individuals (Tung et al. 2016) by John Blischak in Yoav Gilad’s lab at the University of Chicago.

First, create the scater SCESet classes: pheno_data &lt;- new(&quot;AnnotatedDataFrame&quot;, anno) rownames(pheno_data) &lt;- pheno_data$sample_id umi &lt;- scater::newSCESet( countData = molecules, phenoData = pheno_data ) Remove genes that are not expressed in any cell: keep_feature &lt;- rowSums(counts(umi) &gt; 0) &gt; 0 umi &lt;- umi[keep_feature, ] Define control features (genes) - ERCC spike-ins and mitochondrial genes (provided by the authors): ercc &lt;- featureNames(umi)[grepl(&quot;ERCC-&quot;, featureNames(umi))] mt &lt;- c(&quot;ENSG00000198899&quot;, &quot;ENSG00000198727&quot;, &quot;ENSG00000198888&quot;, &quot;ENSG00000198886&quot;, &quot;ENSG00000212907&quot;, &quot;ENSG00000198786&quot;, &quot;ENSG00000198695&quot;, &quot;ENSG00000198712&quot;, &quot;ENSG00000198804&quot;, &quot;ENSG00000198763&quot;, &quot;ENSG00000228253&quot;, &quot;ENSG00000198938&quot;, &quot;ENSG00000198840&quot;) Calculate the quality metrics: umi &lt;- scater::calculateQCMetrics( umi, feature_controls = list(ERCC = ercc, MT = mt) ) 9.3 Cell QC 9.3.1 Library size Next we consider the total number of RNA molecules detected per sample (if we were using read counts rather than UMI counts this would be the total number of reads). Wells with few reads/molecules are likely to have been broken or failed to capture a cell, and should thus be removed. hist( umi$total_counts, breaks = 100 ) abline(v = 25000, col = &quot;red&quot;) Figure 9.1: Histogram of library sizes for all cells Exercise 1 How many cells does our filter remove? What distribution do you expect that the total number of molecules for each cell should follow? Our answer Table 9.2: The number of cells removed by total counts filter (FALSE) filter_by_total_counts Freq FALSE 46 TRUE 818 9.3.2 Detected genes (1) In addition to ensuring sufficient sequencing depth for each sample, we also want to make sure that the reads are distributed across the transcriptome. Thus, we count the total number of unique genes detected in each sample. hist( umi$total_features, breaks = 100 ) abline(v = 7000, col = &quot;red&quot;) Figure 9.2: Histogram of the number of detected genes in all cells From the plot we conclude that most cells have between 7,000-10,000 detected genes, which is normal for high-depth scRNA-seq. However, this varies by experimental protocol and sequencing depth. For example, droplet-based methods or samples with lower sequencing-depth typically detect fewer genes per cell. The most notable feature in the above plot is the “heavy tail” on the left hand side of the distribution. If detection rates were equal across the cells then the distribution should be approximately normal. Thus we remove those cells in the tail of the distribution (fewer than 7,000 detected genes). Exercise 2 How many cells does our filter remove? Our answer Table 9.3: The number of cells removed by total features filter (FALSE) filter_by_expr_features Freq FALSE 120 TRUE 744 9.3.3 ERCCs and MTs Another measure of cell quality is the ratio between ERCC spike-in RNAs and endogenous RNAs. This ratio can be used to estimate the total amount of RNA in the captured cells. Cells with a high level of spike-in RNAs had low starting amounts of RNA, likely due to the cell being dead or stressed which may result in the RNA being degraded. scater::plotPhenoData( umi, aes_string(x = &quot;total_features&quot;, y = &quot;pct_counts_feature_controls_MT&quot;, colour = &quot;batch&quot;) ) Figure 9.3: Percentage of counts in MT genes scater::plotPhenoData( umi, aes_string(x = &quot;total_features&quot;, y = &quot;pct_counts_feature_controls_ERCC&quot;, colour = &quot;batch&quot;) ) Figure 9.4: Percentage of counts in ERCCs The above analysis shows that majority of the cells from NA19098.r2 batch have a very high ERCC/Endo ratio. Indeed, it has been shown by the authors that this batch contains cells of smaller size. Exercise 3 Create filters for removing batch NA19098.r2 and cells with high expression of mitochondrial genes (&gt;10% of total counts in a cell). Our answer Table 9.4: The number of cells removed by ERCC filter (FALSE) filter_by_ERCC Freq FALSE 96 TRUE 768 Table 9.4: The number of cells removed by MT filter (FALSE) filter_by_MT Freq FALSE 31 TRUE 833 Exercise 4 What would you expect to see in the ERCC vs counts plot if you were examining a dataset containing cells of different sizes (eg. normal &amp; senescent cells)? Answer You would expect to see a group corresponding to the smaller cells (normal) with a higher fraction of ERCC reads than a separate group corresponding to the larger cells (senescent). 9.4 Cell filtering 9.4.1 Manual Now we can define a cell filter based on our previous analysis: umi$use &lt;- ( # sufficient features (genes) filter_by_expr_features &amp; # sufficient molecules counted filter_by_total_counts &amp; # sufficient endogenous RNA filter_by_ERCC &amp; # remove cells with unusual number of reads in MT genes filter_by_MT ) knitr::kable( as.data.frame(table(umi$use)), booktabs = TRUE, row.names = FALSE, caption = &#39;The number of cells removed by manual filter (FALSE)&#39; ) Table 9.5: The number of cells removed by manual filter (FALSE) Var1 Freq FALSE 210 TRUE 654 9.4.2 Default Thresholds Results from the biological analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data are often strongly influenced by outliers. Thus, it is important to include multiple filters. A robust way of detecting outliers is through the median absolute difference which is defined as \\(d_i = |r_i - m|\\), where \\(r_i\\) is the number of reads in cell \\(i\\) and \\(m\\) is the median number of reads across the all cells in the sample. By default, scater removes all cells where \\(d_i&gt;5*\\)median(\\(d_i\\)). A similar filter is used for the number of detected genes. Furthermore, scater removes all cells where &gt;80% of counts were assigned to control genes and any cells that have been marked as controls. umi$use_default &lt;- ( # remove cells with unusual numbers of genes !umi$filter_on_total_features &amp; # remove cells with unusual numbers molecules counted !umi$filter_on_total_counts &amp; # &lt; 80% ERCC spike-in !umi$filter_on_pct_counts_feature_controls_ERCC &amp; # &lt; 80% mitochondrial !umi$filter_on_pct_counts_feature_controls_MT &amp; # controls shouldn&#39;t be used in downstream analysis !umi$is_cell_control ) knitr::kable( as.data.frame(table(umi$use_default)), booktabs = TRUE, row.names = FALSE, caption = &#39;The number of cells removed by default filter (FALSE)&#39; ) Table 9.6: The number of cells removed by default filter (FALSE) Var1 Freq FALSE 6 TRUE 858 9.4.3 Automatic Another option available in scater is to conduct PCA on a set of QC metrics and then use automatic outlier detection to identify potentially problematic cells. By default, the following metrics are used for PCA-based outlier detection: pct_counts_top_100_features total_features pct_counts_feature_controls n_detected_feature_controls log10_counts_endogenous_features log10_counts_feature_controls scater first creates a matrix where the rows represent cells and the columns represent the different QC metrics. Here, the PCA plot provides a 2D representation of cells ordered by their quality metrics. The outliers are then detected using methods from the mvoutlier package. umi &lt;- scater::plotPCA(umi, size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;, shape_by = &quot;use&quot;, pca_data_input = &quot;pdata&quot;, detect_outliers = TRUE, return_SCESet = TRUE) ## The following cells/samples are detected as outliers: ## NA19098.r2.A01 ## NA19098.r2.A02 ## NA19098.r2.A06 ## NA19098.r2.A09 ## NA19098.r2.A10 ## NA19098.r2.A12 ## NA19098.r2.B01 ## NA19098.r2.B03 ## NA19098.r2.B04 ## NA19098.r2.B05 ## NA19098.r2.B07 ## NA19098.r2.B11 ## NA19098.r2.B12 ## NA19098.r2.C01 ## NA19098.r2.C02 ## NA19098.r2.C03 ## NA19098.r2.C04 ## NA19098.r2.C05 ## NA19098.r2.C06 ## NA19098.r2.C07 ## NA19098.r2.C08 ## NA19098.r2.C09 ## NA19098.r2.C10 ## NA19098.r2.C11 ## NA19098.r2.C12 ## NA19098.r2.D01 ## NA19098.r2.D02 ## NA19098.r2.D03 ## NA19098.r2.D04 ## NA19098.r2.D07 ## NA19098.r2.D08 ## NA19098.r2.D09 ## NA19098.r2.D10 ## NA19098.r2.D12 ## NA19098.r2.E01 ## NA19098.r2.E02 ## NA19098.r2.E03 ## NA19098.r2.E04 ## NA19098.r2.E05 ## NA19098.r2.E06 ## NA19098.r2.E07 ## NA19098.r2.E12 ## NA19098.r2.F01 ## NA19098.r2.F02 ## NA19098.r2.F07 ## NA19098.r2.F08 ## NA19098.r2.F09 ## NA19098.r2.F10 ## NA19098.r2.F11 ## NA19098.r2.F12 ## NA19098.r2.G01 ## NA19098.r2.G02 ## NA19098.r2.G03 ## NA19098.r2.G05 ## NA19098.r2.G06 ## NA19098.r2.G08 ## NA19098.r2.G09 ## NA19098.r2.G10 ## NA19098.r2.G11 ## NA19098.r2.H01 ## NA19098.r2.H02 ## NA19098.r2.H03 ## NA19098.r2.H04 ## NA19098.r2.H05 ## NA19098.r2.H06 ## NA19098.r2.H07 ## NA19098.r2.H08 ## NA19098.r2.H10 ## NA19098.r2.H12 ## NA19101.r3.A02 ## NA19101.r3.C12 ## NA19101.r3.D01 ## NA19101.r3.E08 ## Variables with highest loadings for PC1 and PC2: ## ## PC1 PC2 ## --------------------------------- ----------- ---------- ## pct_counts_top_100_features 0.4771343 0.3009332 ## pct_counts_feature_controls 0.4735839 0.3309562 ## n_detected_feature_controls 0.1332811 0.5367629 ## log10_counts_feature_controls -0.1427373 0.5911762 ## total_features -0.5016681 0.2936705 ## log10_counts_endogenous_features -0.5081855 0.2757918 Figure 9.5: PCA plot used for automatic detection of cell outliers knitr::kable( as.data.frame(table(umi$outlier)), booktabs = TRUE, row.names = FALSE, caption = &#39;The number of cells removed by automatic filter (FALSE)&#39; ) Table 9.7: The number of cells removed by automatic filter (FALSE) Var1 Freq FALSE 791 TRUE 73 9.5 Compare filterings Exercise 5 Compare the default, automatic and manual cell filters. Plot a Venn diagram of the outlier cells from these filterings. Hint: Use limma::vennCounts and limma::vennDiagram functions from the limma package to make a Venn diagram. Answer Figure 9.6: Comparison of the default, automatic and manual cell filters 9.6 Gene analysis 9.6.1 Gene expression In addition to removing cells with poor quality, it is usually a good idea to exclude genes where we suspect that technical artefacts may have skewed the results. Moreover, inspection of the gene expression profiles may provide insights about how the experimental procedures could be improved. It is often instructive to consider the number of reads consumed by the top 50 expressed genes. scater::plotQC(umi, type = &quot;highest-expression&quot;) Figure 9.7: Number of total counts consumed by the top 50 expressed genes The distributions are relatively flat indicating (but not guaranteeing!) good coverage of the full transcriptome of these cells. However, there are several spike-ins in the top 15 genes which suggests a greater dilution of the spike-ins may be preferrable if the experiment is to be repeated. 9.6.2 Gene filtering It is typically a good idea to remove genes whose expression level is considered “undetectable”. We define a gene as detectable if at least two cells contain more than 1 transcript from the gene. If we were considering read counts rather than UMI counts a reasonable threshold is to require at least five reads in at least two cells. However, in both cases the threshold strongly depends on the sequencing depth. It is important to keep in mind that genes must be filtered after cell filtering since some genes may only be detected in poor quality cells (note pData(umi)$use filter applied to the umi dataset). filter_genes &lt;- apply(counts(umi[ , pData(umi)$use]), 1, function(x) length(x[x &gt; 1]) &gt;= 2) fData(umi)$use &lt;- filter_genes knitr::kable( as.data.frame(table(filter_genes)), booktabs = TRUE, row.names = FALSE, caption = &#39;The number of genes removed by gene filter (FALSE)&#39; ) Table 9.8: The number of genes removed by gene filter (FALSE) filter_genes Freq FALSE 4663 TRUE 14063 Depending on the cell-type, protocol and sequencing depth, other cut-offs may be appropriate. 9.7 Save the data Dimensions of the QCed dataset (do not forget about the gene filter we defined above): dim(umi[fData(umi)$use, pData(umi)$use]) ## Features Samples ## 14063 654 Save the data: saveRDS(umi, file = &quot;blischak/umi.rds&quot;) If you want to further check yourself you can download our umi object.

We will explore different ways of visualizing the data to allow you to asses what happened to the expression matrix after the quality control step. scater package provides several very useful functions to simplify visualisation. One important aspect of single-cell RNA-seq is to control for batch effects. Batch effects are technical artefacts that are added to the samples during handling. For example, if two sets of samples were prepared in different labs or even on different days in the same lab, then we may observe greater similarities between the samples that were handled together. In the worst case scenario, batch effects may be mistaken for true biological variation. The Blischak data allows us to explore these issues in a controlled manner since some of the salient aspects of how the samples were handled have been recorded. Ideally, we expect to see batches from the same individual grouping together and distinct groups corresponding to each individual. library(scater, quietly = TRUE) options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) umi &lt;- readRDS(&quot;blischak/umi.rds&quot;) umi.qc &lt;- umi[fData(umi)$use, pData(umi)$use] endog_genes &lt;- !fData(umi.qc)$is_feature_control 11.2 PCA plot The easiest way to overview the data is by transforming it using the principal component analysis and then visualize the first two principal components. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses a transformation to convert a set of observations into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components (PCs). The number of principal components is less than or equal to the number of original variables. Mathematically, the PCs correspond to the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. The eigenvectors are sorted by eigenvalue so that the first principal component accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible, and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to the preceding components (the figure below is taken from here). Figure 11.1: Schematic representation of PCA dimensionality reduction 11.2.1 Before QC scater::plotPCA(umi[endog_genes, ], ntop = 500, colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;, size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;, shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;counts&quot;) Figure 11.2: PCA plot of the blischak data 11.2.2 After QC scater::plotPCA(umi.qc[endog_genes, ], ntop = 500, colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;, size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;, shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;counts&quot;) Figure 11.3: PCA plot of the blischak data Comparing Figure 11.2 and Figure 11.3, it is clear that after quality control the NA19098.r2 cells no longer form a group of outliers. By default only the top 500 most variable genes are used by scater to calculate the PCA. This can be adjusted by changing the ntop argument. Exercise 1 How do the PCA plots change if when all 14,214 genes are used? Or when only top 50 genes are used? Why does the fraction of variance accounted for by the first PC change so dramatically? Our answer Figure 11.4: PCA plot of the blischak data (14214 genes) Figure 11.5: PCA plot of the blischak data (50 genes) If your answers are different please compare your code with ours (you need to search for this exercise in the opened file). 11.3 tSNE map An alternative to PCA for visualizing scRNASeq data is a tSNE plot. tSNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) combines dimensionality reduction (e.g. PCA) with random walks on the nearest-neighbour network to map high dimensional data (i.e. our 14,214 dimensional expression matrix) to a 2-dimensional space while preserving local distances between cells. In contrast with PCA, tSNE is a stochastic algorithm which means running the method multiple times on the same dataset will result in different plots. Due to the non-linear and stochastic nature of the algorithm, tSNE is more difficult to intuitively interpret tSNE. To ensure reproducibility, we fix the “seed” of the random-number generator in the code below so that we always get the same plot. 11.3.1 Before QC scater::plotTSNE(umi[endog_genes, ], ntop = 500, perplexity = 130, colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;, size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;, shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;counts&quot;, rand_seed = 123456) Figure 11.6: tSNE map of the blischak data 11.3.2 After QC scater::plotTSNE(umi.qc[endog_genes, ], ntop = 500, perplexity = 130, colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;, size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;, shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;counts&quot;, rand_seed = 123456) Figure 11.7: tSNE map of the blischak data Interpreting PCA and tSNE plots is often challenging and due to their stochastic and non-linear nature, they are less intuitive. However, in this case it is clear that they provide a similar picture of the data. Comparing Figure 11.6 and 11.7, it is again clear that the samples from NA19098.r2 are no longer outliers after the QC filtering. Furthermore tSNE requires you to provide a value of “perplexity” which reflects the number of neighbours used to build the nearest-neighbour network; a high value creates a dense network which clumps cells together while a low value makes the network more sparse allowing groups of cells to separate from each other. scater uses a default perplexity of the total number of cells divided by five (rounded down). You can read more about the pitfalls of using tSNE here. Exercise 2 How do the tSNE plots change when a perplexity of 10 or 200 is used? How does the choice of perplexity affect the interpretation of the results? Our answer Figure 11.8: tSNE map of the blischak data (perplexity = 10) Figure 11.9: tSNE map of the blischak data (perplexity = 200) If your answers are different please compare your code with ours (you need to search for this exercise in the opened file). 11.4 Big Exercise Perform the same analysis with read counts of the Blischak data.

One of the main challenges in analyzing scRNA-seq data stems from the fact that it is difficult to carry out a true technical replicate (why?) to distinguish biological and technical variability. In the previous chapters we considered batch effects and in this chapter we will continue to explore how experimental artifacts can be identified and removed. We will continue using the scater package since it provides a set of methods specifically for quality control of experimental and explanatory variables. Moreover, we will continue to work with the Blischak data that was used in the previous chapter. library(scater, quietly = TRUE) options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) umi &lt;- readRDS(&quot;blischak/umi.rds&quot;) umi.qc &lt;- umi[fData(umi)$use, pData(umi)$use] endog_genes &lt;- !fData(umi.qc)$is_feature_control The umi.qc dataset contains filtered cells and genes. Our next step is to explore technical drivers of variability in the data to inform data normalisation before downstream analysis. 13.2 Correlations with PCs Let’s first look again at the PCA plot of the QCed dataset: scater::plotPCA(umi.qc[endog_genes, ], colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;, size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;counts&quot;) Figure 13.1: PCA plot of the blischak data scater allows one to identify principal components that correlate with experimental and QC variables of interest (it ranks principle components by \\(R^2\\) from a linear model regressing PC value against the variable of interest). Let’s test whether some of the variables correlate with any of the PCs. 13.2.1 Detected genes scater::plotQC(umi.qc[endog_genes, ], type = &quot;find-pcs&quot;, variable = &quot;total_features&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;counts&quot;) Figure 13.2: PC correlation with the number of detected genes Indeed, we can see that PC1 can be almost completely explained by the number of the detected genes. In fact, it was also visible on the PCA plot above. This is a well-known issue in scRNA-seq and was described here. 13.3 Explanatory variables scater can also compute the marginal \\(R^2\\) for each variable when fitting a linear model regressing expression values for each gene against just that variable, and display a density plot of the gene-wise marginal \\(R^2\\) values for the variables. scater::plotQC(umi.qc[endog_genes, ], type = &quot;expl&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;counts&quot;, variables = c(&quot;total_features&quot;, &quot;total_counts&quot;, &quot;batch&quot;, &quot;individual&quot;, &quot;pct_counts_feature_controls_ERCC&quot;, &quot;pct_counts_feature_controls_MT&quot;)) Figure 13.3: Explanatory variables This analysis indicates that the number of detected genes (again) and also the sequencing depth (number of counts) have substantial explanatory power for many genes, so these variables are good candidates for conditioning out in a normalisation step, or including in downstream statistical models. Expression of ERCCs also appears to be an important explanatory variable. One notable feature of the above plot is that batch explains more than individual, what does that tell us about the technical and biological variability of the data? 13.4 Other confounders In addition to correcting for batch, there are other factors that one may want to compensate for. As with batch correction, these adjustments require extrinsic information. One popular method is scLVM which allows you to identify and subtract the effect from processes such as cell-cycle or apoptosis. In addition, protocols may differ in terms of their coverage of each transcript, their bias based on the average content of A/T nucleotides, or their ability to capture short transcripts. Ideally, we would like to compensate for all of these differences and biases. 13.5 Exercise Perform the same analysis with read counts of the Blischak data.

This can be done by providing a design matrix to normaliseExprs(). We are not covering this topic here, but you can try to do it yourself as an exercise. Instead we will explore how simple size-factor normalisations correcting for library size can remove the effects of some of the confounders and explanatory variables. 15.2 Library size Library sizes vary because scRNA-seq data is often sequenced on highly multiplexed platforms the total reads which are derived from each cell may differ substantially. Some quantification methods (eg. Cufflinks, RSEM) incorporated library size when determining gene expression estimates thus do not require this normalization. However, if another quantification method was used then library size must be corrected for by multiplying or dividing each column of the expression matrix by a “normalization factor” which is an estimate of the library size relative to the other cells. Many methods to correct for library size have been developped for bulk RNA-seq and can be equally applied to scRNA-seq (eg. UQ, SF, CPM, RPKM, FPKM, TPM). 15.3 Normalisations The simplest way to normalize this data is to convert it to counts per million (CPM) by dividing each column by its total then multiplying by 1,000,000. Note that spike-ins should be excluded from the calculation of total expression in order to correct for total cell RNA content, therefore we will only use endogenous genes. calc_cpm &lt;- function (expr_mat, spikes = NULL) { norm_factor &lt;- colSums(expr_mat[-spikes, ]) return(t(t(expr_mat)/norm_factor)) * 10^6 } One potential drawback of CPM is if your sample contains genes that are both very highly expressed and differentially expressed across the cells. In this case, the total molecules in the cell may depend of whether such genes are on/off in the cell and normalizing by total molecules may hide the differential expression of those genes and/or falsely create differential expression for the remaining genes. Note: RPKM, FPKM and TPM are variants on CPM which further adjust counts by the length of the respective gene/transcript. To deal with this potentiality several other measures were devised: The size factor (SF) was proposed and popularized by DESeq (Anders and Huber (2010)). First the geometric mean of each gene across all cells is calculated. The size factor for each cell is the median across genes of the ratio of the expression to the gene’s geometric mean. A drawback to this method is that since it uses the geometric mean only genes with non-zero expression values across all cells can be used in its calculation, making it unadvisable for large low-depth scRNASeq experiments. edgeR &amp; scater call this method RLE for “relative log expression”. calc_sf &lt;- function (expr_mat, spikes = NULL) { geomeans &lt;- exp(rowMeans(log(expr_mat[-spikes, ]))) SF &lt;- function(cnts) { median((cnts/geomeans)[(is.finite(geomeans) &amp; geomeans &gt; 0)]) } norm_factor &lt;- apply(expr_mat[-spikes, ], 2, SF) return(t(t(expr_mat)/norm_factor)) } The upperquartile (UQ) was proposed by Bullard et al (2010). Here each column is divided by the 75% quantile of the counts for each library. Often the calculated quantile is scaled by the median across cells to keep the absolute level of expression relatively consistent. A drawback to this method is that for low-depth scRNASeq experiments the large number of undetected genes may result in the 75% quantile being zero (or close to it). This limitation can be overcome by generalizing the idea and using a higher quantile (eg. the 99% quantile is the default in scater) or by excluding zeros prior to calculating the 75% quantile. calc_uq &lt;- function (expr_mat, spikes = NULL) { UQ &lt;- function(x) { quantile(x[x &gt; 0], 0.75) } uq &lt;- unlist(apply(expr_mat[-spikes, ], 2, UQ)) norm_factor &lt;- uq/median(uq) return(t(t(expr_mat)/norm_factor)) } Another method is called TMM is the weighted trimmed mean of M-values (to the reference) proposed by Robinson and Oshlack (2010). The M-values in question are the gene-wise log2 fold changes between individual cells. One cell is used as the reference then the M-values for each other cell is calculated compared to this reference. These values are then trimmed by removing the top and bottom ~30%, and the average of the remaining values is calculated by weighting them to account for the effect of the log scale on variance. Each non-reference cell is multiplied by the calculated factor. Two potential issues with this method are insufficient non-zero genes left after trimming, and the assumption that most genes are not differentially expressed. Finally the scran package implements a variant on CPM specialized for single-cell data (Lun et al 2016). Briefly this method deals with the problem of vary large numbers of zero values per cell by pooling cells together calculating a normalization factor (similar to CPM) for the sum of each pool. Since each cell is found in many different pools, cell-specific factors can be deconvoluted from the collection of pool-specific factors using linear algebra. We will use visual inspection of PCA plots and calculation of cell-wise relative log expression (calc_cell_RLE()) to compare the efficiency of different normalization methods. Cells with many[few] reads have higher[lower] than median expression for most genes resulting in a positive[negative] RLE across the cell, whereas normalized cells have an RLE close to zero. calc_cell_RLE &lt;- function (expr_mat, spikes = NULL) { RLE_gene &lt;- function(x) { if (median(unlist(x)) &gt; 0) { log((x + 1)/(median(unlist(x)) + 1))/log(2) } else { rep(NA, times = length(x)) } } if (!is.null(spikes)) { RLE_matrix &lt;- t(apply(expr_mat[-spikes, ], 1, RLE_gene)) } else { RLE_matrix &lt;- t(apply(expr_mat, 1, RLE_gene)) } cell_RLE &lt;- apply(RLE_matrix, 2, median, na.rm = T) return(cell_RLE) } The RLE, TMM, and UQ size-factor methods were developed for bulk RNA-seq data and, depending on the experimental context, may not be appropriate for single-cell RNA-seq data, as their underlying assumptions may be problematically violated. Lun et al (2016) recently published a size-factor normalisation method specifically designed for scRNA-seq data and accounting for single-cell biases, which we will call LSF (Lun Sum Factors). Briefly, expression values are summed across pools of cells and the summed values are used to compute normalization size-factors per pool. The pool-based size factors can then be deconvolved into cell-specific size factors, which can be used for normalization in the same way as other size factors. scater acts as a wrapper for the calcNormFactors function from edgeR which implements several library size normalization methods making it easy to apply any of these methods to our data. The LSF method is implementated in the Bioconductor package scran, which allows seamless integrationinto the scater workflow. (The scran package itself depends on scater). Note: edgeR makes extra adjustments to some of the normalization methods which may result in somewhat different results than if the original methods are followed exactly, e.g. edgeR’s and scater’s “RLE” method which is based on the “size factor” used by DESeq may give different results to the estimateSizeFactorsForMatrix method in the DESeq/DESeq2 packages. In addition, some versions of edgeR will not calculate the normalization factors correctly unless lib.size is set at 1 for all cells. We will continue to work with the Blischak data that was used in the previous chapter. library(scRNA.seq.funcs) library(scater, quietly = TRUE) options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) set.seed(1234567) umi &lt;- readRDS(&quot;blischak/umi.rds&quot;) umi.qc &lt;- umi[fData(umi)$use, pData(umi)$use] endog_genes &lt;- !fData(umi.qc)$is_feature_control 15.3.1 Raw scater::plotPCA(umi.qc[endog_genes, ], colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;, size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;, shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;counts&quot;) Figure 15.1: PCA plot of the blischak data boxplot(calc_cell_RLE(counts(umi.qc[endog_genes, ])), col = &quot;grey50&quot;, ylab = &quot;RLE&quot;, main = &quot;&quot;, ylim=c(-1,1)) Figure 15.2: Cell-wise RLE of the blischak data 15.3.2 CPM scater performs this normalisation by default, you can control it by changing exprs_values parameter to &quot;exprs&quot;. scater::plotPCA(umi.qc[endog_genes, ], colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;, size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;, shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;exprs&quot;) Figure 15.3: PCA plot of the blischak data after CPM normalisation boxplot(calc_cell_RLE(exprs(umi.qc[endog_genes, ])), col = &quot;grey50&quot;, ylab = &quot;RLE&quot;, main = &quot;&quot;, ylim = c(-1,1)) Figure 15.4: Cell-wise RLE of the blischak data 15.3.3 TMM umi.qc &lt;- scater::normaliseExprs(umi.qc, method = &quot;TMM&quot;, feature_set = endog_genes) scater::plotPCA(umi.qc[endog_genes, ], colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;, size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;, shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;norm_counts&quot;) Figure 15.5: PCA plot of the blischak data after TMM normalisation boxplot(calc_cell_RLE(norm_counts(umi.qc[endog_genes, ])), col = &quot;grey50&quot;, ylab = &quot;RLE&quot;, main = &quot;&quot;, ylim=c(-1,1)) Figure 15.6: Cell-wise RLE of the blischak data 15.3.4 scran qclust &lt;- scran::quickCluster(umi.qc, min.size = 30) umi.qc &lt;- scran::computeSumFactors(umi.qc, sizes = 15, clusters = qclust) umi.qc &lt;- scater::normalize(umi.qc) scater::plotPCA(umi.qc[endog_genes, ], colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;, size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;, shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;exprs&quot;) Figure 15.7: PCA plot of the blischak data after LSF normalisation boxplot(calc_cell_RLE(exprs(umi.qc[endog_genes, ])), col = &quot;grey50&quot;, ylab = &quot;RLE&quot;, main = &quot;&quot;, ylim=c(-1,1)) Figure 15.8: Cell-wise RLE of the blischak data 15.3.5 Size-factor (RLE) umi.qc &lt;- scater::normaliseExprs(umi.qc, method = &quot;RLE&quot;, feature_set = endog_genes) scater::plotPCA(umi.qc[endog_genes, ], colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;, size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;, shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;norm_counts&quot;) Figure 15.9: PCA plot of the blischak data after RLE normalisation boxplot(calc_cell_RLE(norm_counts(umi.qc[endog_genes, ])), col = &quot;grey50&quot;, ylab = &quot;RLE&quot;, main = &quot;&quot;, ylim=c(-1,1)) Figure 15.10: Cell-wise RLE of the blischak data 15.3.6 Upperquantile umi.qc &lt;- scater::normaliseExprs(umi.qc, method = &quot;upperquartile&quot;, feature_set = endog_genes, p = 0.99) scater::plotPCA(umi.qc[endog_genes, ], colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;, size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;, shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;norm_counts&quot;) Figure 15.11: PCA plot of the blischak data after UQ normalisation boxplot(calc_cell_RLE(norm_counts(umi.qc[endog_genes, ])), col = &quot;grey50&quot;, ylab = &quot;RLE&quot;, main = &quot;&quot;, ylim = c(-1, 1)) Figure 15.12: Cell-wise RLE of the blischak data 15.4 Downsampling A final way to correct for library size is to downsample the expression matrix so that each cell has approximately the same total number of molecules. The benefit of this method is that zero values will be introduced by the down sampling thus eliminating any biases due to differing numbers of detected genes. However, the major drawback is that the process is not deterministic so each time the downsampling is run the resulting expression matrix is slightly different. Thus, often analyses must be run on multiple downsamplings to ensure results are robust. Down_Sample_Matrix &lt;- function (expr_mat) { min_lib_size &lt;- min(colSums(expr_mat)) down_sample &lt;- function(x) { prob &lt;- min_lib_size/sum(x) return(unlist(lapply(x, function(y) { rbinom(1, y, prob) }))) } down_sampled_mat &lt;- apply(expr_mat, 2, down_sample) return(down_sampled_mat) } norm_counts(umi.qc) &lt;- scRNA.seq.funcs::Down_Sample_Matrix(counts(umi.qc)) scater::plotPCA(umi.qc[endog_genes, ], colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;, size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;, shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;norm_counts&quot;) Figure 15.13: PCA plot of the blischak data after downsampling tmp &lt;- norm_counts(umi.qc[endog_genes, ]) # ignore genes which are not detected in any cells following downsampling boxplot(calc_cell_RLE(tmp[rowMeans(tmp) &gt; 0, ]), col = &quot;grey50&quot;, ylab = &quot;RLE&quot;, main = &quot;&quot;, ylim = c(-1, 1)) Figure 15.14: Cell-wise RLE of the blischak data 15.5 Normalizing for gene/transcript length Some methods combine library size and fragment/gene length normalization such as: RPKM - Reads Per Kilobase Million (for single-end sequencing) FPKM - Fragments Per Kilobase Million (same as RPKM but for paired-end sequencing, makes sure that paired ends mapped to the same fragment are not counted twice) TPM - Transcripts Per Kilobase Million (same as RPKM, but the order of normalizations is reversed - length first and sequencing depth second) These methods are not applicable to our dataset since the end of the transcript which contains the UMI was preferentially sequenced. Furthermore in general these should only be calculated using appropriate quantification software from aligned BAM files not from read counts since often only a portion of the entire gene/transcript is sequenced, not the entire length. If in doubt check for a relationship between gene/transcript length and expression level. However, here we show how these normalisations can be calculated using scater. First, we need to find the effective transcript length in Kilobases. However, our dataset containes only gene IDs, therefore we will be using the gene lengths instead of transcripts. scater uses the biomaRt package, which allows one to annotate genes by other attributes: umi.qc &lt;- scater::getBMFeatureAnnos(umi.qc, filters = &quot;ensembl_gene_id&quot;, attributes = c(&quot;ensembl_gene_id&quot;, &quot;hgnc_symbol&quot;, &quot;chromosome_name&quot;, &quot;start_position&quot;, &quot;end_position&quot;), feature_symbol = &quot;hgnc_symbol&quot;, feature_id = &quot;ensembl_gene_id&quot;, biomart = &quot;ENSEMBL_MART_ENSEMBL&quot;, dataset = &quot;hsapiens_gene_ensembl&quot;, host = &quot;www.ensembl.org&quot;) # If you have mouse data, change the arguments based on this example: # scater::getBMFeatureAnnos(object, # filters = &quot;ensembl_transcript_id&quot;, # attributes = c(&quot;ensembl_transcript_id&quot;, # &quot;ensembl_gene_id&quot;, &quot;mgi_symbol&quot;, # &quot;chromosome_name&quot;, # &quot;transcript_biotype&quot;, # &quot;transcript_start&quot;, # &quot;transcript_end&quot;, # &quot;transcript_count&quot;), # feature_symbol = &quot;mgi_symbol&quot;, # feature_id = &quot;ensembl_gene_id&quot;, # biomart = &quot;ENSEMBL_MART_ENSEMBL&quot;, # dataset = &quot;mmusculus_gene_ensembl&quot;, # host = &quot;www.ensembl.org&quot;) Some of the genes were not annotated, therefore we filter them out: umi.qc.ann &lt;- umi.qc[!is.na(fData(umi.qc)$ensembl_gene_id), ] Now we compute the total gene length in Kilobases by using the end_position and start_position fields: eff_length &lt;- abs(fData(umi.qc.ann)$end_position - fData(umi.qc.ann)$start_position)/1000 plot(eff_length, rowMeans(counts(umi.qc.ann))) Figure 15.15: Gene length vs Mean Expression for the raw data There is no relationship between gene length and mean expression so FPKMs &amp; TPMs are inappropriate for this dataset. But we will demonstrate them anyway. Now we are ready to perform the normalisations: tpm(umi.qc.ann) &lt;- calculateTPM( umi.qc.ann, eff_length ) fpkm(umi.qc.ann) &lt;- calculateFPKM( umi.qc.ann, eff_length ) Plot the results as a PCA plot: scater::plotPCA(umi.qc.ann, colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;, size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;, shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;fpkm&quot;) Figure 15.16: PCA plot of the blischak data after FPKM normalisation scater::plotPCA(umi.qc.ann, colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;, size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;, shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;tpm&quot;) Figure 15.17: PCA plot of the blischak data after TPM normalisation Note: The PCA looks for differences between cells. Gene length is the same across cells for each gene thus FPKM is almost identical to the CPM plot (it is just rotated) since it performs CPM first then normalizes gene length. Whereas, TPM is different because it weights genes by their length before performing CPM. 15.6 Exercise Perform the same analysis with read counts of the Blischak data.

Now we will consider removing other less well defined confounders from our data. Technical confounders (aka batch effects) can arise from difference in reagents, isolation methods, the lab/experimenter who performed the experiment, even which day/time the experiment was performed. Accounting for technical confounders, and batch effects particularly, is a large topic that also involves principles of experimental design. Here we address approaches that can be taken to account for confounders when the experimental design is appropriate. Fundamentally, accounting for technical confounders involves identifying and, ideally, removing sources of variation in the expression data that are not related to (i.e. are confounding) the biological signal of interest. Various approaches exist, some of which use spike-in or housekeeping genes, and some of which use endogenous genes. 17.1.1 Advantages and disadvantages of using spike-ins to remove confounders The use of spike-ins as control genes is appealing, since the same amount of ERCC (or other) spike-in was added to each cell in our experiment. In principle, all the variablity we observe for these genes is due to technical noise; whereas endogenous genes are affected by both technical noise and biological variability. Technical noise can be removed by fitting a model to the spike-ins and “substracting” this from the endogenous genes. There are several methods available based on this premise (eg. BASiCS, scLVM, RUVg); each using different noise models and different fitting procedures. Alternatively, one can identify genes which exhibit significant variation beyond technical noise (eg. Distance to median, Highly variable genes). However, there are issues with the use of spike-ins for normalisation (particularly ERCCs, derived from bacterial sequences), including that their variability can, for various reasons, actually be higher than that of endogenous genes. Given the issues with using spike-ins, better results can often be obtained by using endogenous genes instead. Where we have a large number of endogenous genes that, on average, do not vary systematically between cells and where we expect technical effects to affect a large number of genes (a very common and reasonable assumption), then such methods (for example, the RUVs method) can perform well. We explore both general approaches below. 17.1.2 How to evaluate and compare confounder removal strategies A key question when considering the different methods for removing confounders is how to quantitatively determine which one is the most effective. The main reason why comparisons are challenging is because it is often difficult to know what corresponds to technical counfounders and what is interesting biological variability. Here, we consider three different metrics which are all reasonable based on our knowledge of the experimental design. Depending on the biological question that you wish to address, it is important to choose a metric that allows you to remove the confounders that are likely to be the biggest concern for the given situation. library(scRNA.seq.funcs) library(RUVSeq) library(scater, quietly = TRUE) library(scran) library(edgeR) set.seed(1234567) options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) umi &lt;- readRDS(&quot;blischak/umi.rds&quot;) umi.qc &lt;- umi[fData(umi)$use, pData(umi)$use] endog_genes &lt;- !fData(umi.qc)$is_feature_control erccs &lt;- fData(umi.qc)$is_feature_control 17.2 Remove Unwanted Variation Factors contributing to technical noise frequently appear as “batch effects” where cells processed on different days or by different technicians systematically vary from one another. Removing technical noise and correcting for batch effects can frequently be performed using the same tool or slight variants on it. We will be considering the Remove Unwanted Variation (RUVSeq). Briefly, RUVSeq works as follows. For \\(n\\) samples and \\(J\\) genes, consider the following generalized linear model (GLM), where the RNA-Seq read counts are regressed on both the known covariates of interest and unknown factors of unwanted variation: \\[\\log E[Y|W,X,O] = W\\alpha + X\\beta + O\\] Here, \\(Y\\) is the \\(n \\times J\\) matrix of observed gene-level read counts, \\(W\\) is an \\(n \\times k\\) matrix corresponding to the factors of “unwanted variation” and \\(O\\) is an \\(n \\times J\\) matrix of offsets that can either be set to zero or estimated with some other normalization procedure (such as upper-quartile normalization). The simultaneous estimation of \\(W\\), \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(k\\) is infeasible. For a given \\(k\\), instead the following three approaches to estimate the factors of unwanted variation \\(W\\) are used: RUVg uses negative control genes (e.g. ERCCs), assumed to have constant expression across samples; RUVs uses centered (technical) replicate/negative control samples for which the covariates of interest are constant; RUVr uses residuals, e.g., from a first-pass GLM regression of the counts on the covariates of interest. We will concentrate on the first two approaches. 17.2.1 RUVg ruvg &lt;- RUVg(counts(umi.qc), erccs, k = 1) set_exprs(umi.qc, &quot;ruvg1&quot;) &lt;- ruvg$normalizedCounts ruvg &lt;- RUVg(counts(umi.qc), erccs, k = 2) set_exprs(umi.qc, &quot;ruvg2&quot;) &lt;- ruvg$normalizedCounts set_exprs(umi.qc, &quot;ruvg2_logcpm&quot;) &lt;- log2(t(t(ruvg$normalizedCounts) / colSums(ruvg$normalizedCounts) * 1e6) + 1) 17.2.2 RUVs scIdx &lt;- matrix(-1, ncol = max(table(umi.qc$individual)), nrow = 3) tmp &lt;- which(umi.qc$individual == &quot;NA19098&quot;) scIdx[1, 1:length(tmp)] &lt;- tmp tmp &lt;- which(umi.qc$individual == &quot;NA19101&quot;) scIdx[2, 1:length(tmp)] &lt;- tmp tmp &lt;- which(umi.qc$individual == &quot;NA19239&quot;) scIdx[3, 1:length(tmp)] &lt;- tmp cIdx &lt;- rownames(umi.qc) ruvs &lt;- RUVs(counts(umi.qc), cIdx, k = 1, scIdx = scIdx, isLog = FALSE) set_exprs(umi.qc, &quot;ruvs1&quot;) &lt;- ruvs$normalizedCounts ruvs &lt;- RUVs(counts(umi.qc), cIdx, k = 2, scIdx = scIdx, isLog = FALSE) set_exprs(umi.qc, &quot;ruvs2&quot;) &lt;- ruvs$normalizedCounts set_exprs(umi.qc, &quot;ruvs2_logcpm&quot;) &lt;- log2(t(t(ruvs$normalizedCounts) / colSums(ruvs$normalizedCounts) * 1e6) + 1) 17.3 Effectiveness 1 We evaluate the effectiveness of the normalization by inspecting the PCA plot where colour corresponds the technical replicates and shape corresponds to different biological samples (individuals). Separation of biological samples and interspersed batches indicates that technical variation has been removed. plotPCA( umi.qc[endog_genes, ], colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;, size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;, shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;ruvg1&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;PCA - RUVg normalisation: k = 1&quot;) plotPCA( umi.qc[endog_genes, ], colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;, size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;, shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;ruvg2&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;PCA - RUVg normalisation: k = 2&quot;) plotPCA( umi.qc[endog_genes, ], colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;, size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;, shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;ruvs1&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;PCA - RUVs normalisation: k = 1&quot;) plotPCA( umi.qc[endog_genes, ], colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;, size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;, shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;ruvs2&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;PCA - RUVs normalisation: k = 2&quot;) plotPCA( umi.qc[endog_genes, ], colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;, size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;, shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;, exprs_values = &quot;ruvs2_logcpm&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;PCA - RUVs normalisation log2-cpm: k = 2&quot;) Plotting log2-normalized CPM from RUVs with k = 2 looks to give the best separation of cells by individual. 17.4 Effectiveness 2 We can also examine the effectiveness of correction using the relative log expression (RLE) across cells to confirm technical noise has been removed from the dataset. boxplot( list( &quot;Raw counts&quot; = calc_cell_RLE(counts(umi.qc), erccs), &quot;RUVg (k = 1)&quot; = calc_cell_RLE(assayData(umi.qc)$ruvg1, erccs), &quot;RUVg (k = 2)&quot; = calc_cell_RLE(assayData(umi.qc)$ruvg2, erccs), &quot;RUVs (k = 1)&quot; = calc_cell_RLE(assayData(umi.qc)$ruvs1, erccs), &quot;RUVs (k = 2)&quot; = calc_cell_RLE(assayData(umi.qc)$ruvs2, erccs) ) ) 17.5 Effectiveness 3 Another way of evaluating the effectiveness of correction is to look at the differentially expressed (DE) genes among the batches of the same individual Theoretically, these batches should not differ from each other. Let’s take the most promising individual (NA19101, whose batches are the closest to each other) and check whether it is true. For demonstration purposes we will only use a subset of cells.

The exact nature of the analysis depends on the dataset. Nevertheless, there are a few aspects that are useful in a wide range of contexts and we will be discussing some of them in the next few chapters. We will start with the clustering of scRNA-seq data. 19.1 Introduction One of the most promising applications of scRNA-seq is de novo discovery and annotation of cell-types based on transcription profiles. Computationally, this is a hard problem as it amounts to unsupervised clustering. That is, we need to identify groups of cells based on the similarities of the transcriptomes without any prior knowledge of the labels. Moreover, in most situations we do not even know the number of clusters a priori. The problem is made even more challenging due to the high level of noise (both technical and biological) and the large number of dimensions (i.e. genes). 19.2 Dimensionality reductions When working with large datasets, it can often be beneficial to apply some sort of dimensionality reduction method. By projecting the data onto a lower-dimensional sub-space, one is often able to significantly reduce the amount of noise. An additional benefit is that it is typically much easier to visualize the data in a 2 or 3-dimensional subspace. We have already discussed PCA (chapter 11.2) and t-SNE (chapter 11.2). 19.3 Clustering methods Unsupervised clustering is useful in many different applications and it has been widely studied in machine learning. Some of the most popular approaches are hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering and graph-based clustering. 19.3.1 Hierarchical clustering In hierarchical clustering, one can use either a bottom-up or a top-down approach. In the former case, each cell is initially assigned to its own cluster and pairs of clusters are subsequently merged to create a hieararchy: Figure 19.1: Raw data Figure 19.2: The hierarchical clustering dendrogram With a top-down strategy, one instead starts with all observations in one cluster and then recursively split each cluster to form a hierarchy. One of the advantages of this strategy is that the method is deterministic. 19.3.2 k-means In k-means clustering, the goal is to partition N cells into k different clusters. In an iterative manner, cluster centers are assigned and each cell is assigned to its nearest cluster: Figure 19.3: Schematic representation of the k-means clustering Most methods for scRNA-seq analysis includes a k-means step at some point. 19.3.3 Graph-based methods Over the last two decades there has been a lot of interest in analyzing networks in various domains. One goal is to identify groups or modules of nodes in a network. Figure 19.4: Schematic representation of the graph network Some of these methods can be applied to scRNA-seq data by building a graph where each node represents a cell. Note that constructing the graph and assigning weights to the edges is not trivial. One advantage of graph-based methods is that some of them are very efficient and can be applied to networks containing millions of nodes. 19.4 Challenges in clustering What is the number of clusters k? Scalability: in the last 2 years the number of cells in scRNA-seq experiments has grown by 2 orders of magnitude from ~\\(10^2\\) to ~\\(10^4\\) Tools are not user-friendly 19.5 Tools for scRNA-seq data 19.5.1 SINCERA SINCERA (Guo et al. 2015) is based on hierarchical clustering Data is converted to z-scores before clustering Identify k by finding the first singleton cluster in the hierarchy 19.5.2 pcaReduce pcaReduce (Žurauskienė and Yau 2016) combines PCA, k-means and “iterative” hierarchical clustering. Starting from a large number of clusters pcaReduce iteratively merges similar clusters; after each merging event it removes the principle component explaning the least variance in the data. 19.5.3 SC3 Figure 19.5: SC3 pipeline SC3 (Kiselev et al. 2016) is based on PCA and spectral dimensionality reductions Utilises k-means Additionally performs the consensus clustering 19.5.4 tSNE + k-means Based on tSNE maps Utilises k-means 19.5.5 SEURAT SEURAT (Macosko et al. 2015) first utilises PCA on a set of cells, then a number of statistically significant PCs is defined. Those PCs are further projected to a 2D space using tSNE. The remaining cells are then projected on the same tSNE map. Density clustering algorithm (DBSCAN) is then used to identify cell clusters in the 2D space. Note In the newest versions of SEURAT (v. 1.3-1.4) the tSNE is now used exclusively for visualization, and clustering is based on a community detection approach similar to one previously proposed for analyzing CyTOF data (Levine et al. 2015). 19.5.6 SNN-Cliq SNN-Cliq (C. Xu and Su 2015) is a graph-based method. First the method identifies the k-nearest-neighbours of each cell according to the distance measure. This is used to calculate the number of Shared Nearest Neighbours (SNN) between each pair of cells. A graph is built by placing an edge between two cells If they have at least one SNN. Clusters are defined as groups of cells with many edges between them using a “clique” method. SNN-Cliq requires several parameters to be defined manually. References "],

It is well known that this disease is highly heterogeneous with multiple sub-clones co-existing within the same patient. 20.1 Patient dataset Traditionally, clonal heterogeneity is assessed by genotyping sub-clones. Genotyping through Sanger sequencing of two key loci (missense mutations of the Jak2 and Tet2 genes) has been carried out for this patient and has revealed the presence of 3 different sub-clones (WT/WT, WT/Tet2 and Jak2/Tet2). Our goal is to identify clusters corresponding to the three genotypes from the scRNA-seq data. Although genotyping allows us to identify the different sub-clones, it does not provide any information about their transcriptome. By characterizing the transcriptomes we could obtain new insights, e.g. identify marker genes that would allow us to sort the cells using FACS or to understand which pathways are affected by the different mutants. patient.data &lt;- read.table(&quot;clustering/patient.txt&quot;, sep = &quot;\\t&quot;) For convenience we have performed all quality control and normalization steps (SF + RUVg) in advance. The dataset contains 51 cells and 8710 genes. Now we are ready to cluster the data using the methods described in the previous chapter. 20.2 SC3 SC3 is a clustering tool and it does not provide functions for the sequencing quality control (QC) or normalisation. On the contrary, it is expected that these preprocessing steps are performed by a user in advance. To facilitate the preprocessing, SC3 is integrated with the scater package (see previous chapters). To the best of our knowledge scater is the most comprehensive toolkit for the QC and normalisation analysis of the single-cell RNA-Seq data. If you already have an object of scater class SCESet then you should proceed to the next code chunk. If you have a matrix containing cell/gene expression values then you can create a scater object using your matrix: patient.sceset &lt;- newSCESet(countData = patient.data) patient.sceset &lt;- calculateQCMetrics(patient.sceset) Now we are ready ro run the SC3 clustering: patient.sceset &lt;- sc3(patient.sceset, ks = 2:5, k_estimator = TRUE, biology = TRUE) When the clustering is done you will be able to visualise the clustering results in many different ways. See the SC3 vignette for more details. SC3 also has a useful function for summarising/visualising the results in an interactive Shiny session: sc3_interactive(patient.sceset) This command will open SC3 in a web browser. Once it has opened please perform the following exercises: Exercise 1: Explore different clustering solutions for \\(k\\) from 2 to 5. Also try to change the consensus averaging by checking and unchecking distance and transformation check boxes in the left panel of SC3. Exercise 2: Based on the genotyping and SC3 prediction, we strongly believe that \\(k =3\\) provides the best clustering. What evidence do you find for this in the clustering? How can you use the silhouette plots to motivate choosing the value of \\(k\\) that you think looks best? Exercise 3: Which clusters are the most stable? You can find out how different cells migrate between clusters using the “Cell Labels”/“Stability” tabs panel. Exercise 4: Check out differentially expressed genes and marker genes for the obtained clusterings. Please use \\(k=3\\). Exercise 5: Change the marker genes threshold (the default is 0.85). Does SC3 find more marker genes? 20.3 pcaReduce pcaReduce is another clustering tool and it does not provide QC or normalisation. Unlike SC3 which operates on the distance matrix, pcaReduce operates directly on the expression matrix. It is recommended to use a gene filter and log transformation before running pcaReduce. We will used the default SC3 gene filter to remove highly and lowly expressed genes. # use the same gene filter as in SC3 input &lt;- patient.data[fData(patient.sceset)$sc3_gene_filter, ] # log transform before the analysis input.log &lt;- log2(input + 1) There are several parameters used by pcaReduce: * nbt defines a number of pcaReduce runs (the method is stochastic and may have different solutions after different runs) * q defines number of dimensions to start clustering with. The output will contain partitions for all \\(k\\) from 2 to q+1. * method defines a method used for clustering. S - to perform sampling based merging, M - to perform merging based on largest probability. We will run pcaReduce 10 times: # run pcaReduce 10 times creating hierarchies from 1 to 30 clusters pca.red &lt;- PCAreduce(t(input.log), nbt = 10, q = 30, method = &#39;S&#39;) Let’s compare the clusterings (with \\(k\\) = 3) provided after running pcaReduce 10 times: res &lt;- unique(scRNA.seq.funcs::merge_pcaReduce_results(pca.red, 3)) pheatmap(res, legend = FALSE, show_rownames = FALSE, main = &quot;Columns - cells, Rows - clusterings, Colors - clusters&quot;) Figure 20.1: Clustering solutions of pcaReduce method after running it for 10 times and selecting \\(k=3\\) Exercise 6: Run pcaReduce for \\(k=2\\), \\(k=4\\) and \\(k=5\\). Is it easy to choose the optimal \\(k\\)? Hint: When running pcaReduce for different \\(k\\)s you do not need to rerun pcaReduce::PCAreduce function, just use already calculated pca.red object. Our solutions: Figure 20.2: Clustering solutions of pcaReduce method after running it for 10 times and selecting \\(k=2\\). Figure 20.3: Clustering solutions of pcaReduce method after running it for 10 times and selecting \\(k=4\\). Figure 20.4: Clustering solutions of pcaReduce method after running it for 10 times and selecting \\(k=5\\). Exercise 7: Compare the results between SC3 and pcaReduce. What is the main difference between the solutions? 20.4 tSNE + kmeans tSNE plots that we saw before (11.3) were made by using the Rtsne and ggplot2 packages. We can create similar plots explicitly: tsne_out &lt;- Rtsne::Rtsne(t(input.log), perplexity = 10) df_to_plot &lt;- as.data.frame(tsne_out$Y) comps &lt;- colnames(df_to_plot)[1:2] ggplot2::ggplot(df_to_plot, aes_string(x = comps[1], y = comps[2])) + geom_point() + xlab(&quot;Dimension 1&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Dimension 2&quot;) + theme_bw() Figure 20.5: tSNE map of the patient data Note that all points on the plot above are black. This is different from what we saw before, when the cells were coloured based on the annotation. Here we do not have any annotation and all cells come from the same batch, therefore all dots are black. Now we are going to apply k-means clustering algorithm to the cloud of points on the tSNE map. Do you see 2/3/4/5 groups in the cloud? We will start with \\(k=2\\): clusts &lt;- kmeans( tsne_out$Y, centers = 2, iter.max = 1e+09, nstart = 1000)$clust df_to_plot$clusts &lt;- factor(clusts, levels = unique(clusts)) comps &lt;- colnames(df_to_plot)[1:3] ggplot2::ggplot(df_to_plot, aes_string(x = comps[1], y = comps[2], color = comps[3])) + geom_point() + xlab(&quot;Dimension 1&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Dimension 2&quot;) + theme_bw() Figure 20.6: tSNE map of the patient data with 2 colored clusters, identified by the k-means clustering algorithm Exercise 7: Make the same plots for \\(k=3\\), \\(k=4\\) and \\(k=5\\). Exercise 8: Compare the results between SC3 and tSNE+kmeans. Can the results be improved by changing the perplexity parameter? As you may have noticed, both pcaReduce and tSNE+kmeans are stochastic and give different results every time they are run. To get a better overview of the solutions, we need to run the methods multiple times. Here we run tSNE+kmeans clustering 10 times with \\(k = 3\\) (with perplexity = 10): tsne.res &lt;- scRNA.seq.funcs::tsne_mult(input.log, 3, 10) res &lt;- unique(do.call(rbind, tsne.res)) SC3 is also stochastic, but thanks to the consensus step, it is more robust and less likely to produce different outcomes. Exercise 9: Visualize the different clustering solutions using a heatmap. Then run tSNE+kmeans algorithm with \\(k = 2\\) or \\(k = 4\\) and see how the clustering looks like in these cases. Figure 20.7: Clustering solutions of tSNE+kmeans method after running it for 10 times and using \\(k=3\\) Figure 20.8: Clustering solutions of tSNE+kmeans method after running it for 10 times and using \\(k=2\\) Figure 20.9: Clustering solutions of tSNE+kmeans method after running it for 10 times and using \\(k=4\\) 20.5 SNN-Cliq Here we run SNN-cliq with the default parameters provided used in the authors’ example: distan &lt;- &quot;euclidean&quot; par.k &lt;- 3 par.r &lt;- 0.7 par.m &lt;- 0.5 # construct a graph scRNA.seq.funcs::SNN( data = t(input.log), outfile = &quot;snn-cliq.txt&quot;, k = par.k, distance = distan ) # find clusters in the graph snn.res &lt;- system( paste0( &quot;python snn-cliq/Cliq.py &quot;, &quot;-i snn-cliq.txt &quot;, &quot;-o res-snn-cliq.txt &quot;, &quot;-r &quot;, par.r, &quot; -m &quot;, par.m ), intern = TRUE ) cat(paste(snn.res, collapse = &quot;\\n&quot;)) ## input file snn-cliq.txt ## find 7 quasi-cliques ## merged into 2 clusters ## unique assign done snn.res &lt;- read.table(&quot;res-snn-cliq.txt&quot;) # remove files that were created during the analysis system(&quot;rm snn-cliq.txt res-snn-cliq.txt&quot;) Exercise 10: How can you characterize the solution identified by SNN-Cliq? Run SNN-Cliq algorithm with different values of k, r, m and distance, and see how the clustering looks like in these cases. 20.6 SINCERA As mentioned in the previous chapter SINCERA is based on hierarchical clustering. It is important to keep in mind is that SINCERA performs a gene-level z-score transformation before clustering: # perform gene-by-gene per-sample z-score transformation dat &lt;- apply(input, 1, function(y) scRNA.seq.funcs::z.transform.helper(y)) # hierarchical clustering dd &lt;- as.dist((1 - cor(t(dat), method = &quot;pearson&quot;))/2) hc &lt;- hclust(dd, method = &quot;average&quot;) If the number of cluster is not known SINCERA can identify k as the minimum height of the hierarchical tree that generates no more than a specified number of singleton clusters (clusters containing only 1 cell) num.singleton &lt;- 0 kk &lt;- 1 for (i in 2:dim(dat)[2]) { clusters &lt;- cutree(hc, k = i) clustersizes &lt;- as.data.frame(table(clusters)) singleton.clusters &lt;- which(clustersizes$Freq &lt; 2) if (length(singleton.clusters) &lt;= num.singleton) { kk &lt;- i } else { break; } } cat(kk) ## 1 Exercise 11: Visualize the SINCERA results as a heatmap. How do the results compare to the other methods? What happens if you choose \\(k = 3\\)? Our answer: Figure 20.10: Clustering solutions of SINCERA method using \\(k=3\\) Exercise 12: Is using the singleton cluster criteria for finding k a good idea? 20.7 SEURAT Here we follow an example created by the authors of SEURAT. We had to introduce some modifications due to the errors produced by the original code: Note In the newest versions of SEURAT (v. 1.3-1.4) the tSNE is now used exclusively for visualization, and clustering is based on a community detection approach similar to one previously proposed for analyzing CyTOF data (Levine et al. 2015). In this tutorial we are still using an old version (v. 1.2) of SEURAT (this will be updated by the next time this course is run - approximately Fall 2017): library(Seurat) # Create a SEURAT object d &lt;- new(&quot;seurat&quot;, raw.data = as.data.frame(log(patient.data + 1))) # Setup a SEURAT object d &lt;- setup( d, project = &quot;NBT&quot;, min.cells = 3, names.field = 2, names.delim = &quot;_&quot;, min.genes = 10, is.expr = 1 ) # Genes placed into 20 bins based on X-axis (average expression). # Y-axis is within-bin z-score of log(Variance/mean). d &lt;- mean.var.plot( d, y.cutoff = 2, x.low.cutoff = 2, fxn.x = expMean, fxn.y = logVarDivMean ) # Run a PCA using the variable genes as input d &lt;- pca(d, do.print = FALSE, pcs.store = 25) # Do 200 random samplings to find significant genes, # each time randomly permute 1% of genes. # This returns a &#39;p-value&#39; for each gene in each PC, # based on how likely the gene/PC score would have been observed by chance d &lt;- jackStraw( d, num.replicate = 200, do.print = FALSE, num.pc = 25 ) # Compare the distribution of P-values for each PC with a uniform distribution. # &#39;Significant&#39; PCs will have a strong enrichment of genes with low p-values pAll &lt;- d@jackStraw.empP pAll$Contig &lt;- rownames(pAll) pAll.l &lt;- melt(pAll, id.vars = &quot;Contig&quot;) colnames(pAll.l) &lt;- c(&quot;Contig&quot;, &quot;PC&quot;, &quot;Value&quot;) score.df &lt;- NULL score.thresh=1e-5 for (i in unique(pAll.l$PC)){ q &lt;- qqplot(pAll[, i], runif(1000), plot.it = FALSE) pc.score &lt;- prop.test( c( length(which(pAll[, i] &lt;= score.thresh)), floor(nrow(pAll) * score.thresh) ), c(nrow(pAll), nrow(pAll)) )$p.val if (length(which(pAll[, i] &lt;= score.thresh)) == 0) pc.score &lt;- 1 if(is.null(score.df)) score.df &lt;- data.frame(PC = i, Score = pc.score) else score.df &lt;- rbind(score.df, data.frame(PC = i, Score = pc.score)) } # There are no significant PCs: head(score.df) ## PC Score ## 1 PC1 1 ## 2 PC2 1 ## 3 PC3 1 ## 4 PC4 1 ## 5 PC5 1 ## 6 PC6 1 ndim &lt;- 2 # Project data on a 2D using tSNE d &lt;- run_tsne(d, dims.use = 1:ndim, max_iter = 2000) # Find clusters in the tSNE map d &lt;- DBclust_dimension( d, 1, 2, reduction.use = &quot;tsne&quot;, G.use = 8, set.ident = TRUE ) tsne.plot(d, pt.size = 1) Exercise 13: As you can see DBSCAN could find only one cluster. It is known that DBSCAN cannot cluster data sets well with large differences in densities, since the G.use parameter cannot then be chosen appropriately for all clusters. Try to change G.use to be able to find more than one cluster in the data. Note We found that in general SEURAT does not work well for small datasets (N &lt; 200 cells). For a comprehensive comparisons of the methods please look at the SC3 paper (Kiselev et al. 2016). References "],

Some recent scRNASeq methods model a different dropout rate for each gene (eg. MAST, BASiCS) while other methods try to fit the relationship between expression level and dropout rate across genes for a specific application (eg. SCDE, ZIFA). We will be using our new package Michaelis-Menten Modelling of Dropouts (M3Drop) which specifically focuses on modelling and gaining biological insights from dropouts. For this section we will be working with the Usoskin et al data. It contains 4 cell types: NP = non-peptidergic nociceptors, PEP = peptidergic nociceptors, NF = neurofilament containing and TH = tyrosine hydroxylase containing neurons. usoskin1 &lt;- readRDS(&quot;usoskin/usoskin1.rds&quot;) dim(usoskin1) ## [1] 25334 622 table(colnames(usoskin1)) ## ## NF NP PEP TH ## 139 169 81 233 21.1 Fitting the models First we must normalize &amp; QC the dataset. M3Drop contains a built-in function for this which removes cells with few detected genes, removes undetected genes, and converts raw counts to CPM. uso_list &lt;- M3Drop::M3DropCleanData( usoskin1, labels = colnames(usoskin1), min_detected_genes = 2000, is.counts = TRUE ) Exercise 1: How many cells &amp; genes have been removed by this filtering? Do you agree with the 2000 detected genes threshold? 21.2 The Michaelis-Menten Equation The Michaelis-Menten (MM) Equation is the standard model of enzyme kinetics. We use it to model dropouts in single-cell RNASeq because most dropouts occur as a result of failing to be reverse-transcribed to sufficient levels. The details are omitted here, but in this model the probability that a transcript will not be present is given by \\[P_{dropout} = K/(K + S)\\] where \\(S\\) is the mRNA concentration in the cell (we will estimate this as average expression) and \\(K\\) is the Michaelis-Menten constant. Other models that have been proposed are: \\(P=Logistic(\\log(S))\\) used by SCDE (determining differential expression) and \\(P=e^{-\\lambda*S^2}\\) used by ZIFA (zero-inflated PCA). Now we will fit all three models to the normalized Usoskin data: models &lt;- M3Drop::M3DropDropoutModels(uso_list$data) title(main = &quot;Usoskin&quot;) 21.3 Right outliers There are many outliers to the right of the fitted MM curve. Genes which are expressed at different levels in subpopulations of our cells will be shifted to the right of the curve. This happens because the MM curve is a convex function, whereas averaging dropout rate and expression is a linear function. Note: add log=&quot;x&quot; to the plot call above to see how this looks on the log scale, which is used in M3Drop figures. Exercise 2: Produce the same plot as above with different expression levels (S1 &amp; S2) and/or mixtures (mix). We use M3Drop to identify significant outliers to the right of the MM curve. We also apply 1% FDR multiple testing correction: DE_genes &lt;- M3Drop::M3DropDifferentialExpression( uso_list$data, mt_method = &quot;fdr&quot;, mt_threshold = 0.01 ) title(main = &quot;Usoskin&quot;) Check which of the known neuron markers are identified as DE: uso_markers &lt;- c(&quot;Nefh&quot;, &quot;Tac1&quot;, &quot;Mrgprd&quot;, &quot;Th&quot;, &quot;Vim&quot;, &quot;B2m&quot;, &quot;Col6a2&quot;, &quot;Ntrk1&quot;, &quot;Calca&quot;, &quot;P2rx3&quot;, &quot;Pvalb&quot;) rbind(uso_markers, uso_markers %in% DE_genes$Gene) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] ## uso_markers &quot;Nefh&quot; &quot;Tac1&quot; &quot;Mrgprd&quot; &quot;Th&quot; &quot;Vim&quot; &quot;B2m&quot; &quot;Col6a2&quot; &quot;Ntrk1&quot; ## &quot;TRUE&quot; &quot;TRUE&quot; &quot;TRUE&quot; &quot;TRUE&quot; &quot;TRUE&quot; &quot;FALSE&quot; &quot;FALSE&quot; &quot;TRUE&quot; ## [,9] [,10] [,11] ## uso_markers &quot;Calca&quot; &quot;P2rx3&quot; &quot;Pvalb&quot; ## &quot;TRUE&quot; &quot;TRUE&quot; &quot;TRUE&quot; 21.4 Validation of DE results We can also plot the expression levels of these genes to check they really are DE genes.

Running differential expression methods which compare two groups at a time is slow for this dataset (6 possible pairs of groups x 15,708 genes) thus we have provided you with the output for DESeq. Load it using: DESeq_table &lt;- readRDS(&quot;usoskin/DESeq_table.rds&quot;) length(unique(DESeq_table$Gene)) ## [1] 2604 We will demonstrate some of the methods starting from the simplest one proposed by Brennecke et al., which identifies genes with significant variation above technical noise (here it is assumed that the technical noise can be estimated using ERCCs). To use the Brennecke method, we first normalize for library size then calculate the mean and the square coefficient of variation (variation divided by the squared mean expression). A quadratic curve is fit to the relationship between these two variables for the ERCC spike-in, and then a chi-square test is used to find genes significantly above the curve. This has been provided for you as the Brennecke_getVariableGenes(counts, spikes) function. However, there are only 9 spike-ins detected in this dataset so we will use the entire dataset to estimate the technical noise. In the figure below the red curve is the fitted technical noise model and the dashed line is the 95% CI. Pink dots are the genes with significant biological variability after multiple-testing correction.

This includes, for example, many differentiation processes taking place during development: following a stimulus, cells will change from one cell-type to another. Ideally, we would like to monitor the expression levels of an individual cell over time. Unfortunately, such monitoring is not possible with scRNA-seq since the cell is lysed (destroyed) when the RNA is extracted. Instead, we must sample at multiple time-points and obtain snapshots of the gene expression profiles. Since some of the cells will proceed faster along the differentiation than others, each snapshot may contain cells at varying points along the developmental progression. We use statistical methods to order the cells along one or more trajectories which represent the underlying developmental trajectories, this ordering is referred to as “pseudotime”. In this chapter we will consider four different tools: Monocle, TSCAN, destiny and SLICER for ordering cells according to their pseudotime development. To illustrate the methods we will be using a dataset on mouse embryonic development (Deng et al. 2014). The dataset consists of 268 cells from 10 different time-points of early mouse development. In this case, there is no need for pseudotime alignment since the cell labels provide information about the development trajectory. Thus, the labels allow us to establish a ground truth so that we can evaluate and compare the different methods. A recent review by Cannoodt et al provides a detailed summary of the various computational methods for trajectory inference from single-cell transcriptomics (Cannoodt, Saelens, and Saeys 2016). They discuss several tools, but unfortunately for our purposes many of these tools do not have complete or well-maintained implementations, and/or are not implemented in R. Cannoodt et al cover: SCUBA - Matlab implementation Wanderlust - Matlab (and requires registration to even download) Wishbone - Python SLICER - R, but package only available on Github SCOUP - C++ command line tool Waterfall - R, but one R script in supplement Mpath - R pkg, but available as tar.gz on Github; function documentation but no vignette/workflow Monocle - Bioconductor package TSCAN - Bioconductor package Unfortunately only two tools discussed (Monocle and TSCAN) meet the gold standard of open-source software hosted in a reputable repository. The following figures from the paper summarise some of the features of the various tools. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;figures/cannoodt_pseudotime_properties.png&quot;) Figure 22.1: Descriptions of trajectory inference methods for single-cell transcriptomics data (Fig. 2 from Cannoodt et al, 2016). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;figures/cannoodt_pseudotime_methods.png&quot;) Figure 22.2: Characterization of trajectory inference methods for single-cell transcriptomics data (Fig. 3 from Cannoodt et al, 2016). 22.1 TSCAN TSCAN combines clustering with pseudotime analysis. First it clusters the cells using mclust, which is based on a mixture of normal distributions. Then it builds a minimum spanning tree to connect the clusters. The branch of this tree that connects the largest number of clusters is the main branch which is used to determine pseudotime. First we will try to use all genes to order the cells. deng &lt;- readRDS(&quot;deng/deng.rds&quot;) cellLabels &lt;- colnames(deng) procdeng &lt;- TSCAN::preprocess(deng) colnames(procdeng) &lt;- 1:ncol(deng) dengclust &lt;- TSCAN::exprmclust(procdeng, clusternum = 10) TSCAN::plotmclust(dengclust) dengorderTSCAN &lt;- TSCAN::TSCANorder(dengclust, orderonly = F) pseudotime_order_tscan &lt;- as.character(dengorderTSCAN$sample_name) We can also examine which timepoints have been assigned to each state: cellLabels[dengclust$clusterid == 10] ## [1] &quot;late2cell&quot; &quot;late2cell&quot; &quot;late2cell&quot; &quot;late2cell&quot; &quot;late2cell&quot; ## [6] &quot;late2cell&quot; &quot;late2cell&quot; &quot;late2cell&quot; &quot;late2cell&quot; &quot;late2cell&quot; ## [11] &quot;mid2cell&quot; &quot;mid2cell&quot; &quot;mid2cell&quot; &quot;mid2cell&quot; &quot;mid2cell&quot; ## [16] &quot;mid2cell&quot; &quot;mid2cell&quot; &quot;mid2cell&quot; &quot;mid2cell&quot; &quot;mid2cell&quot; ## [21] &quot;mid2cell&quot; &quot;mid2cell&quot; colours &lt;- rainbow(n = 10) # red = early, violet = late tmp &lt;- factor( cellLabels[as.numeric(pseudotime_order_tscan)], levels = c(&quot;early2cell&quot;, &quot;mid2cell&quot;, &quot;late2cell&quot;, &quot;4cell&quot;, &quot;8cell&quot;, &quot;16cell&quot;, &quot;earlyblast&quot;, &quot;midblast&quot;, &quot;lateblast&quot;) ) plot( as.numeric(tmp), xlab = &quot;Pseudotime Order&quot;, ylab = &quot;Timepoint&quot;, col = colours[tmp], pch = 16 ) Exercise 1 Compare results for different numbers of clusters (clusternum). 22.2 monocle Monocle skips the clustering stage of TSCAN and directly builds a minimum spanning tree on a reduced dimension representation of the cells to connect all cells. Monocle then identifies the longest path in this tree to determine pseudotime. If the data contains diverging trajectories (i.e. one cell type differentiates into two different cell-types), monocle can identify these. Each of the resulting forked paths is defined as a separate cell state. Unfortunately, Monocle does not work when all the genes are used, so we must carry out feature selection. First, we use M3Drop: m3dGenes &lt;- as.character( M3Drop::M3DropDifferentialExpression(deng)$Gene ) d &lt;- deng[which(rownames(deng) %in% m3dGenes), ] d &lt;- d[!duplicated(rownames(d)), ] Now run monocle: colnames(d) &lt;- 1:ncol(d) geneNames &lt;- rownames(d) rownames(d) &lt;- 1:nrow(d) pd &lt;- data.frame(timepoint = cellLabels) pd &lt;- new(&quot;AnnotatedDataFrame&quot;, data=pd) fd &lt;- data.frame(gene = geneNames) fd &lt;- new(&quot;AnnotatedDataFrame&quot;, data=fd) dCellData &lt;- monocle::newCellDataSet(d, phenoData = pd, featureData = fd) dCellData &lt;- monocle::setOrderingFilter(dCellData, 1:length(m3dGenes)) dCellDataSet &lt;- monocle::reduceDimension(dCellData, pseudo_expr = 1) dCellDataSet &lt;- monocle::orderCells(dCellDataSet, reverse = TRUE) monocle::plot_cell_trajectory(dCellDataSet) # Store the ordering pseudotime_monocle &lt;- data.frame( Timepoint = phenoData(dCellDataSet)$timepoint, pseudotime = phenoData(dCellDataSet)$Pseudotime, State=phenoData(dCellDataSet)$State ) rownames(pseudotime_monocle) &lt;- 1:ncol(d) pseudotime_order_monocle &lt;- rownames(pseudotime_monocle[order(pseudotime_monocle$pseudotime), ]) We can again compare the inferred pseudotime to the known sampling timepoints. monocle_time_point &lt;- factor( pseudotime_monocle$Timepoint, levels = c(&quot;early2cell&quot;, &quot;mid2cell&quot;, &quot;late2cell&quot;, &quot;4cell&quot;, &quot;8cell&quot;, &quot;16cell&quot;, &quot;earlyblast&quot;, &quot;midblast&quot;, &quot;lateblast&quot;) ) plot( pseudotime_monocle$pseudotime, monocle_time_point, xlab = &quot;Pseudotime&quot;, ylab = &quot;Timepoint&quot;, col = colours[monocle_time_point], pch = 16 ) 22.3 Diffusion maps Diffusion maps were introduced by Ronald Coifman and Stephane Lafon, and the underlying idea is to assume that the data are samples from a diffusion process. The method infers the low-dimensional manifold by estimating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the diffusion operator related to the data. Haghverdi et al have applied the diffusion maps concept to the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data to create an R package called destiny. dm &lt;- DiffusionMap(t(log2(1+deng))) tmp &lt;- factor( colnames(deng), levels = c( &quot;early2cell&quot;, &quot;mid2cell&quot;, &quot;late2cell&quot;, &quot;4cell&quot;, &quot;8cell&quot;, &quot;16cell&quot;, &quot;earlyblast&quot;, &quot;midblast&quot;, &quot;lateblast&quot; ) ) plot( eigenvectors(dm)[,1], eigenvectors(dm)[,2], xlab=&quot;Diffusion component 1&quot;, ylab=&quot;Diffusion component 2&quot;, col = colours[tmp], pch = 16 ) Like the other methods, destiny does a good job at ordering the early time-points, but it is unable to distinguish the later ones. Exercise 2 Do you get a better resolution between the later time points by considering additional eigenvectors? Exercise 3 How does the ordering change if you only use the genes identified by M3Drop? 22.4 SLICER The SLICER method is an algorithm for constructing trajectories that describe gene expression changes during a sequential biological process, just as Monocle and TSCAN are. SLICER is designed to capture highly nonlinear gene expression changes, automatically select genes related to the process, and detect multiple branch and loop features in the trajectory (Welch, Hartemink, and Prins 2016). The SLICER R package is available from its GitHub repository and can be installed from there using the devtools package. We use the select_genes function in SLICER to automatically select the genes to use in builing the cell trajectory. The function uses “neighbourhood variance” to identify genes that vary smoothly, rather than fluctuating randomly, across the set of cells. Following this, we determine which value of “k” (dimensions) yields an embedding that most resembles a trajectory. Then we estimate the locally linear embedding of the cells. slicer_genes &lt;- select_genes(t(deng)) k &lt;- select_k(t(deng[slicer_genes,]), kmin = 5) ## finding neighbours ## calculating weights ## computing coordinates ## finding neighbours ## calculating weights ## computing coordinates ## finding neighbours ## calculating weights ## computing coordinates ## Warning in if (posigual%/%2 == posigual/2) {: the condition has length &gt; 1 ## and only the first element will be used ## Warning in posigual:(posigual - 1): numerical expression has 3 elements: ## only the first used ## Warning in posigual:(posigual - 1): numerical expression has 3 elements: ## only the first used ## Warning in posigual:(posigual - 1): numerical expression has 3 elements: ## only the first used ## Warning in posigual:(posigual - 1): numerical expression has 3 elements: ## only the first used ## Warning in areaahull(alpha_hull): Problem in area computation (Returns NA) ## finding neighbours ## calculating weights ## computing coordinates ## Warning in min(compl[ind[compl[ind, &quot;r&quot;] &gt; 0], &quot;r&quot;]): no non-missing ## arguments to min; returning Inf ## finding neighbours ## calculating weights ## computing coordinates ## finding neighbours ## calculating weights ## computing coordinates ## Warning in areaahull(alpha_hull): Problem in area computation (Returns NA) ## finding neighbours ## calculating weights ## computing coordinates ## Warning in areaahull(alpha_hull): Problem in area computation (Returns NA) ## finding neighbours ## calculating weights ## computing coordinates ## finding neighbours ## calculating weights ## computing coordinates ## finding neighbours ## calculating weights ## computing coordinates slicer_traj_lle &lt;- lle(t(deng[slicer_genes,]), m = 2, k)$Y ## finding neighbours ## calculating weights ## computing coordinates plot(slicer_traj_lle, xlab = &quot;LLE Comp 1&quot;, ylab = &quot;LLE Comp 2&quot;, main = &quot;Locally linear embedding of cells from SLICER&quot;) With the locally linear embedding computed we can construct a k-nearest neighbour graph that is fully connected. slicer_traj_graph &lt;- conn_knn_graph(slicer_traj_lle, 5) plot(slicer_traj_graph, main = &quot;Fully connected kNN graph from SLICER&quot;) From this graph we can identify “extreme” cells that are candidates for start/end cells in the trajectory. ends &lt;- find_extreme_cells(slicer_traj_graph, slicer_traj_lle) start &lt;- ends[1] Having defined a start cell we can order the cells in the estimated pseudotime. pseudotime_order_slicer&lt;- cell_order(slicer_traj_graph, start) branches &lt;- assign_branches(slicer_traj_graph, start) pseudotime_slicer &lt;- data.frame( Timepoint = cellLabels, pseudotime = NA, State = branches ) pseudotime_slicer$pseudotime[pseudotime_order_slicer] &lt;- 1:length(pseudotime_order_slicer) We can again compare the inferred pseudotime to the known sampling timepoints. SLICER does not provide a pseudotime value per se, just an ordering of cells. slicer_time_point &lt;- factor( pseudotime_slicer$Timepoint, levels = c(&quot;early2cell&quot;, &quot;mid2cell&quot;, &quot;late2cell&quot;, &quot;4cell&quot;, &quot;8cell&quot;, &quot;16cell&quot;, &quot;earlyblast&quot;, &quot;midblast&quot;, &quot;lateblast&quot;) ) plot( pseudotime_slicer$pseudotime, slicer_time_point, xlab = &quot;Pseudotime&quot;, ylab = &quot;Timepoint&quot;, col = colours[slicer_time_point], pch = 16 ) Like the previous method, SLICER here provides a good ordering for the early time points and struggles for later time points. Exercise 4 Do you get a better results if you use different “start” cells? Exercise 5 How does the ordering change if you use a different set of genes from those chosen by SLICER (e.g. the genes identified by M3Drop)? 22.5 Comparison of the methods How do the trajectories inferred by TSCAN and Monocle compare? matched_ordering &lt;- match( pseudotime_order_tscan, pseudotime_order_monocle ) timepoint_ordered &lt;- monocle_time_point[order(pseudotime_monocle$pseudotime)] plot( matched_ordering, xlab = &quot;Monocle Order&quot;, ylab = &quot;TSCAN Order&quot;, col = colours[timepoint_ordered], pch = 16 ) Exercise 6: Compare destiny and SLICER to TSCAN and Monocle. 22.6 Expression of genes through time Each package also enables the visualization of expression through pseudotime. Following individual genes is very helpful for identifying genes that play an important role in the differentiation process. We illustrate the procedure using the Obox6 gene which is known to be important during early development. TSCAN colnames(deng) &lt;- 1:ncol(deng) TSCAN::singlegeneplot( deng[rownames(deng) == &quot;Obox6&quot;, ], dengorderTSCAN ) Monocle monocle::plot_genes_in_pseudotime( dCellDataSet[fData(dCellDataSet)$gene == &quot;Obox6&quot;,], color_by = &quot;timepoint&quot; ) Of course, pseudotime values computed with any method can be added to the pData slot of an SCESet object. Having done that, the full plotting capabilities of the scater package can be used to investigate relationships between gene expression, cell populations and pseudotime. This would be particularly useful for the SLICER results, as SLICER does not provide plotting functions. Exercise 7: Repeat the exercise using a subset of the genes, e.g. the set of highly variable genes that can be obtained using M3Drop::Brennecke_getVariableGenes References "],

By comparing the genes that change between two conditions, e.g. mutant and wild-type or stimulated and unstimulated, it is possible to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying the change. Several different methods, e.g. DESeq2 and edgeR, have been developed for bulk RNA-seq. Moreover, there are also extensive datasets available where the RNA-seq data has been validated using RT-qPCR. These data can be used to benchmark DE finding algorithms. 23.2 Single cell RNA-seq In contrast to the bulk RNA-seq in scRNA-seq we usually do not have a defined set of experimental conditions, but instead, as was shown in the previous chapter (20) we can identify the cell groups by using the unsupervised clustering approach. Once the groups have been identified one can find differentially expressed genes by either looking at the differences in variance between the groups (like the Kruskal-Wallis test implemented in SC3), or by comparing gene expression between clusters in a pairwise manner. In the following chapter we will mainly consider tools developed for the comparison of the two groups of cells. 23.3 Differences in Distribution Unlike bulk RNA-seq, we generally have a large number of samples (i.e. cells) for each group we are comparing in single-cell experiments. Thus we can take advantage of the whole distribution of expression values in each group to identify differences between groups rather than only comparing estimates of mean-expression as is standard for bulk RNASeq. There are two main approaches to comparing distributions. Firstly, we can use existing statistical models/distributions and fit the same type of model to the expression in each group then test for differences in the parameters for each model, or test whether the model fits better if a particular paramter is allowed to be different according to group. For instance in Chapter 17 we used edgeR to test whether allowing mean expression to be different in different batches significantly improved the fit of a negative binomial model of the data. Alternatively, we can use a non-parametric test which does not assume expression values follow any particular distribution, e.g. the KS-test. Non-parametric tests generally convert observed expression values to ranks and test whether the distribution of ranks for one group are signficantly different from the distribution of ranks for the other group. However, some non-parametric methods fail in the presence of a large number of tied values, such as the case for dropouts (zeros) in single-cell RNA-seq expression data. 23.4 Models of single-cell RNASeq data The most common model of RNASeq data is the negative binomial model: set.seed(1) hist(rnbinom(1000, mu=10, size=100), col=&quot;grey50&quot;, xlab=&quot;Read Counts&quot;, main=&quot;Negative Binomial&quot;) Figure 23.1: Negative Binomial distribution of read counts for a single gene across 1000 cells Mean: \\(\\mu = mu\\) Variance: \\(\\sigma^2 = mu + mu^2/size\\) It is parameterized by the mean expression (mu) and the dispersion (size), which is inversely related to the variance. The negative binomial model fits bulk RNA-seq data very well and underlies most statistical methods designed for such data. In addition, it has been show to fit the distribution of molecule counts obtained from data tagged by unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) quite well (Grun et al. 2014, Islam et al. 2011). However, a raw negative binomial model does not fit full-transcript data very well due to the high dropout rates relative to the non-zero read counts. For this type of data a variety of zero-inflated negative binomial models have been proposed (e.g. MAST, SCDE). d = 0.5; counts &lt;- rnbinom(1000, mu=10, size=100); counts[runif(1000) &lt; d] = 0; hist(counts, col=&quot;grey50&quot;, xlab=&quot;Read Counts&quot;, main=&quot;Zero-inflated NB&quot;); Figure 23.2: Zero-inflated Negative Binomial distribution Mean: \\(\\mu = mu \\cdot (1 - d)\\) Variance: \\(\\sigma^2 = mu \\cdot (1-d) \\cdot (1 + d \\cdot mu + mu / size)\\) These models introduce a new parameter d, for the dropout rate, to the negative binomial model. As we saw in Chapter 19, the dropout rate of a gene is strongly correlated with the mean expression of the gene. Different zero-inflated negative binomial models use different relationships between mu and d and some may fit mu and d to the expression of each gene independently. Finally, several methods use a Poisson-Beta distribution which is based on a mechanistic model of transcriptional bursting. There is strong experimental support for this model (Kim and Marioni, 2013) and it provides a good fit to scRNA-seq data but it is less easy to use than the negative-binomial models and much less existing methods upon which to build than the negative binomial model. a = 0.1 b = 0.1 g = 100 lambdas = rbeta(1000, a, b) counts = sapply(lambdas, function(l) {rpois(1, lambda=l)}) hist(counts, col=&quot;grey50&quot;, xlab=&quot;Read Counts&quot;, main=&quot;Poisson-Beta&quot;) Mean: \\(\\mu = g \\cdot a / (a + b)\\) Variance: \\(\\sigma^2 = g^2 \\cdot a \\cdot b/((a + b + 1) \\cdot (a + b)^2)\\) This model uses three parameters: “a” the rate of activation of transcription; “b” the rate of inhibition of transcription; and “g” the rate of transcript production while transcription is active at the locus. Differential expression methods may test each of the parameters for differences across groups or only one (often “g”). All of these models may be further expanded to explicitly account for other sources of gene expression differences such as batch-effect or library depth depending on the particular DE algorithm. Exercise: Vary the parameters of each distribution to explore how they affect the distribution of gene expression. How similar are the Poisson-Beta and Negative Binomial models? "],

Note that we will only be running methods which are available as R-packages and run relatively quickly. 24.2 Kolmogorov-Smirnov test The types of test that are easiest to work with are non-parametric ones. The most commonly used non-parametric test is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS-test) and we can use it to compare the distributions for each gene in the two individuals. The KS-test quantifies the distance between the empirical cummulative distributions of the expression of each gene in each of the two populations. It is sensitive to changes in mean experession and changes in variability. However it assumes data is continuous and may perform poorly when data contains a large number of identical values (eg. zeros). Figure 24.1: Illustration of the two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic. Red and blue lines each correspond to an empirical distribution function, and the black arrow is the two-sample KS statistic. (taken from here) Now run the test: pVals &lt;- apply(norm, 1, function(x) { ks.test(x[group ==&quot;NA19101&quot;], x[group==&quot;NA19239&quot;])$p.value }) # multiple testing correction pVals &lt;- p.adjust(pVals, method = &quot;fdr&quot;) This code “applies” the function to each row (specified by 1) of the expression matrix, data. In the function we are returning just the p.value from the ks.test output. We can now consider how many of the ground truth positive and negative DE genes are detected by the KS-test: 24.2.1 Evaluating Accuracy sigDE &lt;- names(pVals)[pVals &lt; 0.05] length(sigDE) ## [1] 5095 # Number of KS-DE genes sum(GroundTruth$DE %in% sigDE) ## [1] 792 # Number of KS-DE genes that are true DE genes sum(GroundTruth$notDE %in% sigDE) ## [1] 3190 # Number of KS-DE genes that are truly not-DE As you can see many more of our ground truth negative genes were identified as DE by the KS-test (false positives) than ground truth positive genes (true positives), however this may be due to the larger number of notDE genes thus we typically normalize these counts as the True positive rate (TPR), TP/(TP + FN), and False positive rate (FPR), FP/(FP+TP). tp &lt;- sum(GroundTruth$DE %in% sigDE) fp &lt;- sum(GroundTruth$notDE %in% sigDE) tn &lt;- sum(GroundTruth$notDE %in% names(pVals)[pVals &gt;= 0.05]) fn &lt;- sum(GroundTruth$DE %in% names(pVals)[pVals &gt;= 0.05]) tpr &lt;- tp/(tp + fn) fpr &lt;- fp/(fp + tn) cat(c(tpr, fpr)) ## 0.7346939 0.2944706 Now we can see the TPR is much higher than the FPR indicating the KS test is identifying DE genes. So far we’ve only evaluated the performance at a single significance threshold. Often it is informative to vary the threshold and evaluate performance across a range of values. This is then plotted as a reveiver-operating-characteristic curve (ROC) and a general accuracy statistic can be calculated as the area under this curve (AUC). We will use the ROCR package to facilitate this plotting. # Only consider genes for which we know the ground truth pVals &lt;- pVals[names(pVals) %in% GroundTruth$DE | names(pVals) %in% GroundTruth$notDE] truth &lt;- rep(1, times = length(pVals)); truth[names(pVals) %in% GroundTruth$DE] = 0; pred &lt;- ROCR::prediction(pVals, truth) perf &lt;- ROCR::performance(pred, &quot;tpr&quot;, &quot;fpr&quot;) ROCR::plot(perf) Figure 24.2: ROC curve for KS-test. aucObj &lt;- ROCR::performance(pred, &quot;auc&quot;) aucObj@y.values[[1]] # AUC ## [1] 0.7954796 Finally to facilitate the comparisons of other DE methods let’s put this code into a function so we don’t need to repeat it: DE_Quality_AUC &lt;- function(pVals) { pVals &lt;- pVals[names(pVals) %in% GroundTruth$DE | names(pVals) %in% GroundTruth$notDE] truth &lt;- rep(1, times = length(pVals)); truth[names(pVals) %in% GroundTruth$DE] = 0; pred &lt;- ROCR::prediction(pVals, truth) perf &lt;- ROCR::performance(pred, &quot;tpr&quot;, &quot;fpr&quot;) ROCR::plot(perf) aucObj &lt;- ROCR::performance(pred, &quot;auc&quot;) return(aucObj@y.values[[1]]) } 24.3 Wilcox/Mann-Whitney-U Test The Wilcox-rank-sum test is another non-parametric test, but tests specifically if values in one group are greater/less than the values in the other group. Thus it is often considered a test for difference in median expression between two groups; whereas the KS-test is sensitive to any change in distribution of expression values. pVals &lt;- apply(norm, 1, function(x) { wilcox.test(x[group ==&quot;NA19101&quot;], x[group==&quot;NA19239&quot;])$p.value }) # multiple testing correction pVals &lt;- p.adjust(pVals, method = &quot;fdr&quot;) DE_Quality_AUC(pVals) Figure 24.3: ROC curve for Wilcox test. ## [1] 0.8320326 24.4 edgeR We’ve already used edgeR for differential expression in Chapter 17. edgeR is based on a negative binomial model of gene expression and uses a generalized linear model (GLM) framework, the enables us to include other factors such as batch to the model. dge &lt;- DGEList(counts=counts, norm.factors = rep(1, length(counts[1,])), group=group) group_edgeR &lt;- factor(group) design &lt;- model.matrix(~group_edgeR) dge &lt;- estimateDisp(dge, design = design, trend.method=&quot;none&quot;) fit &lt;- glmFit(dge, design) res &lt;- glmLRT(fit) pVals &lt;- res$table[,4] names(pVals) &lt;- rownames(res$table) pVals &lt;- p.adjust(pVals, method = &quot;fdr&quot;) DE_Quality_AUC(pVals) Figure 24.4: ROC curve for edgeR. ## [1] 0.8477189 24.5 Monocle Monocle can use several different models for DE. For count data it recommends the Negative Binomial model (negbinomial.size). For normalized data it recommends log-transforming it then using a normal distribution (gaussianff). Similar to edgeR this method uses a GLM framework so in theory can account for batches, however in practice the model fails for this dataset if batches are included. pd &lt;- data.frame(group=group, batch=batch) rownames(pd) &lt;- colnames(counts) pd &lt;- new(&quot;AnnotatedDataFrame&quot;, data = pd) Obj &lt;- newCellDataSet(as.matrix(counts), phenoData=pd, expressionFamily=negbinomial.size()) Obj &lt;- estimateSizeFactors(Obj) Obj &lt;- estimateDispersions(Obj) res &lt;- differentialGeneTest(Obj,fullModelFormulaStr=&quot;~group&quot;) pVals &lt;- res[,3] names(pVals) &lt;- rownames(res) pVals &lt;- p.adjust(pVals, method = &quot;fdr&quot;) DE_Quality_AUC(pVals) Figure 24.5: ROC curve for Monocle. ## [1] 0.8252662 Exercise: Compare the results using the negative binomial model on counts and those from using the normal/gaussian model (gaussianff()) on log-transformed normalized counts. Answer: Figure 24.6: ROC curve for Monocle-gaussian. ## [1] 0.7357829 24.6 MAST MAST is based on a zero-inflated negative binomial model. It tests for differential expression using a hurdle model to combine tests of discrete (0 vs not zero) and continuous (non-zero values) aspects of gene expression. Again this uses a linear modelling framework to enable complex models to be considered. log_counts &lt;- log(counts+1)/log(2) fData = data.frame(names=rownames(log_counts)) rownames(fData) = rownames(log_counts); cData = data.frame(cond=group) rownames(cData) = colnames(log_counts) obj &lt;- FromMatrix(as.matrix(log_counts), cData, fData) colData(obj)$cngeneson &lt;- scale(colSums(assay(obj)&gt;0)) cond &lt;- factor(colData(obj)$cond) # Model expression as function of condition &amp; number of detected genes zlmCond &lt;- zlm.SingleCellAssay(~cond + cngeneson, obj) ## Warning in .nextMethod(object = object, value = value): Coefficients ## condNA19239 are never estimible and will be dropped. summaryCond &lt;- summary(zlmCond, doLRT=&quot;condNA19101&quot;) summaryDt &lt;- summaryCond$datatable summaryDt &lt;- as.data.frame(summaryDt) pVals &lt;- unlist(summaryDt[summaryDt$component == &quot;H&quot;,4]) # H = hurdle model names(pVals) &lt;- unlist(summaryDt[summaryDt$component == &quot;H&quot;,1]) pVals &lt;- p.adjust(pVals, method = &quot;fdr&quot;) DE_Quality_AUC(pVals) Figure 24.7: ROC curve for MAST. ## [1] 0.8284046 24.7 Slow Methods (&gt;1h to run) These methods are too slow to run today but we encourage you to try them out on your own: 24.8 BPSC BPSC uses the Poisson-Beta model of single-cell gene expression, which we discussed in the previous chapter, and combines it with generalized linear models which we’ve already encountered when using edgeR. BPSC performs comparisons of one or more groups to a reference group (“control”) and can include other factors such as batches in the model. library(BPSC) bpsc_data &lt;- norm[,batch==&quot;NA19101.r1&quot; | batch==&quot;NA19239.r1&quot;] bpsc_group = group[batch==&quot;NA19101.r1&quot; | batch==&quot;NA19239.r1&quot;] control_cells &lt;- which(bpsc_group == &quot;NA19101&quot;) design &lt;- model.matrix(~bpsc_group) coef=2 # group label res=BPglm(data=bpsc_data, controlIds=control_cells, design=design, coef=coef, estIntPar=FALSE, useParallel = FALSE) pVals = res$PVAL pVals &lt;- p.adjust(pVals, method = &quot;fdr&quot;) DE_Quality_AUC(pVals) 24.9 SCDE SCDE is the first single-cell specific DE method. It fits a zero-inflated negative binomial model to expression data using Bayesian statistics. The usage below tests for differences in mean expression of individual genes across groups but recent versions include methods to test for differences in mean expression or dispersion of groups of genes, usually representing a pathway. library(scde) cnts &lt;- apply( counts, 2, function(x) { storage.mode(x) &lt;- &#39;integer&#39; return(x) } ) names(group) &lt;- 1:length(group) colnames(cnts) &lt;- 1:length(group) o.ifm &lt;- scde::scde.error.models( counts = cnts, groups = group, n.cores = 1, threshold.segmentation = TRUE, save.crossfit.plots = FALSE, save.model.plots = FALSE, verbose = 0, min.size.entries = 2 ) priors &lt;- scde::scde.expression.prior( models = o.ifm, counts = cnts, length.out = 400, show.plot = FALSE ) resSCDE &lt;- scde::scde.expression.difference( o.ifm, cnts, priors, groups = group, n.randomizations = 100, n.cores = 1, verbose = 0 ) # Convert Z-scores into 2-tailed p-values pVals &lt;- pnorm(abs(resSCDE$cZ), lower.tail = FALSE) * 2 pVals &lt;- p.adjust(pVals, method = &quot;fdr&quot;) DE_Quality_AUC(pVals) "],

["advanced-exercises.html", "26 Advanced exercises", " 26 Advanced exercises For the final part of the course we would like you to work on more open ended problems. The goal is to carry out the type of analyses that you would be doing for an actual research project. Participants who have their own dataset that they are interested in should feel free to work with them. For other participants we recommend downloading a dataset from the conquer resource (consistent quantification of external rna-seq data). conquer uses Salmon to quantify the transcript abundances in a given sample. For a given organism, the fasta files containing cDNA and ncRNA sequences from Ensembl are complemented with ERCC spike-in sequences, and a Salmon quasi-mapping index is built for the entire catalog. Then Salmon is run to estimate the abundance of each transcript. The abundances estimated by Salmon are summarised and provided to the user in the form of a MultiAssayExperiment object. This object can be downloaded via the buttons in the MultiAssayExperiment column. The provided MultiAssayExperiment object contains two “experiments”, corresponding to the gene-level and transcript-level values. The gene-level experiment contains four “assays”: TPM count count_lstpm (count-scale length-scaled TPMs) avetxlength (the average transcript length, which can be used as offsets in count models based on the count assay, see here). The transcript-level experiment contains three “assays”: TPM count efflength (the effective length estimated by Salmon) The MultiAssayExperiment also contains the phenotypic data (in the pData slot), as well as some metadata for the data set (the genome, the organism and the Salmon index that was used for the quantification). Here we will show you how to create an SCESet from a MultiAssayExperiment object. For example, if you download Shalek2013 dataset you will be able to create an SCESet using the following code: library(MultiAssayExperiment) library(SummarizedExperiment) library(scater) d &lt;- readRDS(&quot;~/Desktop/GSE41265.rds&quot;) cts &lt;- assays(experiments(d)[[&quot;gene&quot;]])[[&quot;count_lstpm&quot;]] tpms &lt;- assays(experiments(d)[[&quot;gene&quot;]])[[&quot;TPM&quot;]] phn &lt;- pData(d) sceset &lt;- newSCESet( countData = cts, tpmData = tpms, phenoData = new(&quot;AnnotatedDataFrame&quot;, data = as.data.frame(phn)) ) You can also see that several different QC metrics have already been pre-calculated on the conquer website. Here are some suggestions for questions that you can explore: There are two mESC datasets from different labs (i.e. Xue and Kumar). Can you merge them and remove the batch effects? Clustering and pseudotime analysis look for different patterns among cells. How might you tell which is more appropriate for your dataset? One of the main challenging in hard clustering is to identify the appropriate value for k. Can you use one or more of the clustering tools to explore the different hierarchies available? What are good mathematical and/or biological criteria for determining k? The choice of normalization strategy matters, but how do you determine which is the best method? Explore the effect of different normalizations on downstream analyses. scRNA-seq datasets are high-dimensional and since most dimensions (ie genes) are not informative. Consequently, dimensionality reduction and feature selection are important when analyzing and visualizing the data. Consider the effect of different feature selection methods and dimensionality reduction on clustering and/or pseudotime inference. One of the main challenges after clustering cells is to interpret the biological relevance of the subpopulations. One approach is to identify gene ontology terms that are enriched for the set of marker genes. Identify marker genes (e.g. using SC3 or M3Drop) and explore the ontology terms using gProfiler, WebGestalt or DAVID. Similarly, when ordering cells according to pseudotime we would like to understand what underlying cellular processes are changing over time. Identify a set of changing genes from the aligned cells and use ontology terms to characterize them. "],
