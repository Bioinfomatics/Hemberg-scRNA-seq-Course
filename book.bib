  abstract    = "Next-generation sequencing technology is a powerful tool for
                 transcriptome analysis. However, under certain conditions,
                 only a small amount of material is available, which requires
                 more sensitive techniques that can preferably be used at the
                 single-cell level. Here we describe a single-cell digital gene
                 expression profiling assay. Using our mRNA-Seq assay with only
                 a single mouse blastomere, we detected the expression of 75\%
                 (5,270) more genes than microarray techniques and identified
                 1,753 previously unknown splice junctions called by at least 5
                 reads. Moreover, 8-19\% of the genes with multiple known
                 transcript isoforms expressed at least two isoforms in the
                 same blastomere or oocyte, which unambiguously demonstrated
                 the complexity of the transcript variants at whole-genome
                 scale in individual cells. Finally, for Dicer1(-/-) and
                 Ago2(-/-) (Eif2c2(-/-)) oocytes, we found that 1,696 and 1,553
                 genes, respectively, were abnormally upregulated compared to
                 wild-type controls, with 619 genes in common.",

                 detail in gene expression analyses, yet its efficient
                 application to single cells is challenged by the small
                 starting amounts of RNA. We have developed CEL-Seq, a method
                 for overcoming this limitation by barcoding and pooling
                 samples before linearly amplifying mRNA with the use of one
                 round of in vitro transcription. We show that CEL-Seq gives
                 more reproducible, linear, and sensitive results than a
                 PCR-based amplification method. We demonstrate the power of
                 this method by studying early C. elegans embryonic development
                 at single-cell resolution. Differential distribution of
                 transcripts between sister cells is seen as early as the
                 two-cell stage embryo, and zygotic expression in the somatic
                 cell lineages is enriched for transcription factors. The
                 robust transcriptome quantifications enabled by CEL-Seq will
                 be useful for transcriptomic analyses of complex tissues
                 containing populations of diverse cell types.",

              function, vary broadly in type and state. Single-cell genomics
              can characterize cell identity and function, but limitations of
              ease and scale have prevented its broad application. Here we
              describe Drop-seq, a strategy for quickly profiling thousands of
              individual cells by separating them into nanoliter-sized aqueous
              droplets, associating a different barcode with each cell’s RNAs,
              and sequencing them all together. Drop-seq analyzes mRNA
              transcripts from thousands of individual cells simultaneously
              while remembering transcripts’ cell of origin. We analyzed
              transcriptomes from 44,808 mouse retinal cells and identified 39
              transcriptionally distinct cell populations, creating a molecular
              atlas of gene expression for known retinal cell classes and novel
              candidate cell subtypes. Drop-seq will accelerate biological
              discovery by enabling routine transcriptional profiling at
