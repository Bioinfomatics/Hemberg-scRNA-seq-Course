                 brought new insights into complex biological phenomena. In
                 particular, genome-wide single-cell measurements such as
                 transcriptome sequencing enable the characterization of
                 cellular composition as well as functional variation in
                 homogenic cell populations. An important step in the
                 single-cell transcriptome analysis is to group cells that
                 belong to the same cell types based on gene expression
                 patterns. The corresponding computational problem is to
                 cluster a noisy high dimensional dataset with substantially
                 fewer objects (cells) than the number of variables (genes).
                 RESULTS: In this article, we describe a novel algorithm named
                 shared nearest neighbor (SNN)-Cliq that clusters single-cell
                 transcriptomes. SNN-Cliq utilizes the concept of shared
                 nearest neighbor that shows advantages in handling
                 high-dimensional data. When evaluated on a variety of
                 synthetic and real experimental datasets, SNN-Cliq
                 outperformed the state-of-the-art methods tested. More
                 importantly, the clustering results of SNN-Cliq reflect the
                 cell types or origins with high accuracy. AVAILABILITY AND

                 routinely generating transcriptomics data at the single cell
                 level. A frequent requirement of single cell expression
                 analysis is the identification of novel patterns of
                 heterogeneity across single cells that might explain complex
                 cellular states or tissue composition. To date, classical
                 statistical analysis tools have being routinely applied, but
                 there is considerable scope for the development of novel
                 statistical approaches that are better adapted to the
                 challenges of inferring cellular hierarchies. RESULTS: We have
                 developed a novel agglomerative clustering method that we call
                 pcaReduce to generate a cell state hierarchy where each
                 cluster branch is associated with a principal component of
                 variation that can be used to differentiate two cell states.
                 Using two real single cell datasets, we compared our approach
                 to other commonly used statistical techniques, such as K-means
                 and hierarchical clustering. We found that pcaReduce was able
                 to give more consistent clustering structures when compared to
                 broad and detailed cell type labels. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel
                 integration of principal components analysis and hierarchical
                 clustering establishes a connection between the representation
                 of the expression data and the number of cell types that can
                 be discovered. In doing so we found that pcaReduce performs
                 better than either technique in isolation in terms of
                 characterising putative cell states. Our methodology is
                 complimentary to other single cell clustering techniques and
                 adds to a growing palette of single cell bioinformatics tools
                 for profiling heterogeneous cell populations.",

                 comprise the embryo. While recent studies using single cell

                 understand cellular heterogeneity in complex biological
                 systems, processing large amounts of RNA-seq data from

                 accessible tools for the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq
                 (scRNA-seq) profiles. The present study presents a generally
                 applicable analytic pipeline (SINCERA: a computational
                 pipeline for SINgle CEll RNA-seq profiling Analysis) for
                 processing scRNA-seq data from a whole organ or sorted cells.

                 cell type specific gene signatures; and 3) the determination
                 of driving forces of given cell types. We applied this
                 pipeline to the RNA-seq analysis of single cells isolated from
                 embryonic mouse lung at E16.5. Through the pipeline analysis,

                 challenges, yet are orchestrated by the same genetic
                 blueprint. A key challenge in biology is thus to understand
                 how genes are expressed in the right place, at the right time,
                 and to the right level. Further, this exquisite control of

                 questions about the performance of different protocols and
                 platforms remain. We used a newly developed pool of 96
                 synthetic RNAs with various lengths, and GC content covering a
                 2(20) concentration range as spike-in controls to measure
                 sensitivity, accuracy, and biases in RNA-seq experiments as
                 well as to derive standard curves for quantifying the
                 abundance of transcripts. We observed linearity between read
                 density and RNA input over the entire detection range and
                 excellent agreement between replicates, but we observed
                 significantly larger imprecision than expected under pure
                 Poisson sampling errors. We use the control RNAs to directly
                 measure reproducible protocol-dependent biases due to GC
                 content and transcript length as well as stereotypic
                 heterogeneity in coverage across transcripts correlated with
                 position relative to RNA termini and priming sequence bias.
                 These effects lead to biased quantification for short
                 transcripts and individual exons, which is a serious problem
                 for measurements of isoform abundances, but that can partially
                 be corrected using appropriate models of bias. By using the
