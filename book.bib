                 1,753 previously unknown splice junctions called by at least 5
                 reads. Moreover, 8-19\% of the genes with multiple known

                 platforms remain. We used a newly developed pool of 96

                 2(20) concentration range as spike-in controls to measure

                 density and RNA input over the entire detection range and
                 excellent agreement between replicates, but we observed
                 significantly larger imprecision than expected under pure

                 These effects lead to biased quantification for short

                 for measurements of isoform abundances, but that can partially

                 the specific computational and analytical challenges that

                 RNA-seq data from bulk cell populations can be readily applied
                 to single-cell RNA-seq data, many new computational strategies
